					<description><![CDATA[I agree with much of what you said about the influence of Hellenistic Judaism since that agrees with what I&#039;ve read in articles. The reason I skimmed only the first 4 chapters of the book, was because the Intro. said that was the part about the Jews&#039; views of the Sabbath.

My point is that I don&#039;t think the authors proved their Sabbath view was respected or the only one among the Hellenistic Jews by quoting only 2 allegorical philosophers instead of multiple rabbis.

There&#039;s a reason why their view is rejected by Jewish scholars today like the Jewish Encyclopedia. 

&quot;Philo used philosophical allegory to attempt to fuse and harmonize Greek philosophy with Jewish philosophy. His method followed the practices of both Jewish exegesis and Stoic philosophy. His allegorical exegesis was important for several Christian Church Fathers, &lt;strong&gt;but he has barely any reception history within Judaism&quot;&lt;/strong&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philo 

&quot;Philo’s works are rambling, having little sense of form; repetitious; artificially rhetorical; and almost devoid of a sense of humour. His style is generally involved, allusive, strongly tinged with mysticism, and often obscure; this may be a result of a deliberate attempt on his part to discourage all but the initiated few. http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/456612/Philo-Judaeus/5688/Originality-of-his-thought 

So I don&#039;t think Philo is a reliable source to build your view of the Sabbath.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Greg, I believe that Christian scholars and Jewish scholars probably interpret what was going on in the intertestamental period (and the time of the NT) differently. They have different presuppositions. It is pretty widely accepted among Christian scholars that Hellenistic/Alexandrian Judaism made its way back to Palestine by the first century via its translation work (LXX, for example) and other writings but also via  the presence of Hellenistic Jews themselves (and their interpretive tendencies). Judaism in Palestine in the first century was not monolithic. Anthony Thistelton, for example, says, &quot;“…in Judaism no single method of interpretation absolutely prevailed over all others…”  “[W]e cannot simply speak of ancient Jewish interpretation as a single thing.” Beckwith and Stott point this out several times in their book. Beckwith, btw, is one of the most respected Protestant intertestamental and first century Jewish literature scholars in the world. His book is much more nuanced than you make it appear. If you have not done so, you should read the whole thing (including the endnotes). You may disagree with his exegesis of particular texts, but his historical work is top-level scholarship and pretty standard as far as its basic premise goes. There were two strands of Judaism in Palestine represented during the first century – Palestinian Judaism and Hellenistic Judaism. Beckwith and Stott show in their book that Jesus understood this and interacted with various nuances among both schools of thought. The Hellenistic tendency was to view the Sabbath for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Jesus seems to agree with the Hellenists.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Amen Greg. The charge that we are not keeping the sabbath is unwarranted as those who trust in Christ are keeping it. Part of the whole point of Hebrews. Paul and the writer to the Hebrews clearly understood its the new creation rest, ie resting in Christs work as a new creation etc]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Rich: Greg, if you have This is the Day by Beckwith and Stott (that’s its original title – I think it has been republished under another title), you will notice that chapters one and two deal with Sabbath in ancient Judaism. There were basically two schools of thought (they argue from primary sources of antiquity) – one seeing Sabbath as old as creation and for all mankind; the other as old as the Jews and for them alone.&lt;/strong&gt;

I just skimmed the first 4 chapters and found only 2 relevant quotes from ancient Jewish writers: Aristobulus and Philo. Neither were rabbis. Both were Jewish, Hellenistic philosophers…

“Aristobulus of Paneas: He lived around the middle of the second century B.C. (Henel suggests 175-170 B.C.; see no. 610, p. 164). An eclectic Jewish philosopher, he combined Pythagorean, Platonic, and Stoic thought with Jewish ideas” http://www.earlyjewishwritings.com/aristobulus.html 

“Philo Judaeus: Alexandrian philosopher; born about 20 B.C. at Alexandria, Egypt; died after 40 C.E...Philo included in his philosophy both Greek wisdom and Hebrew religion, which he sought to fuse and harmonize by means of the art of allegory that he had learned from the Stoics. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;His work was not accepted by contemporary Judaism.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12116-philo-judaeus

“Philo: he names not fewer than sixty-four Greek writers;176 and he either alludes to, or quotes frequently from, such sources as Homer, Hesiod, Pindar, Solon, the great Greek tragedians, Plato, and others. But to him these men were scarcely ‘heathen.’ He had sat at their feet, and learned to weave a system from Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics.” http://www.ccel.org/ccel/edersheim/lifetimes.vi.iv.html 

“Philo was deeply influenced by Middle Platonism,[3] Aristotle, the Neo-Pythagoreans, the Cynics and the Stoics…Philo made extensive use of allegory in his writings“ http://www.earlychurch.org.uk/philo.php 

For Beckwith and Stott to claim these 2 philosophers were respected authorities on Judaism would be like someone today claiming Rob Bell (postmodern philosophy) and Harold Camping (allegorical interpretations) are respected authorities on Christianity. 

For respected authorities, the Jewish Encyclopedia and The Rabbinical Council of America agree God did not intend the Sabbath for all Gentiles.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;Rich: Greg, anti-types under the new covenant do require positive laws for application due to the conditions brought in by the accomplishment of redemption by our Lord. Or, to say the same thing in a different manner, new covenant positive laws are reflective of the redemptive-historical conditions brought in by the sufferings and glory of the Son of Man. Under the new covenant there is circumcision, temple, priesthood, sacrifices, and (according to the Prophets) Sabbath.&lt;/strong&gt;

Of course, but the New Covenant antitypes bring New Covenant/New Creation imperatives (explicit or implied). 

Exodus: Old antitype with old imperatives – New type with new imperatives.
Passover: Old antitype with old imperatives – New type with new imperatives.
Temple: Old antitype with old imperatives – New type with new imperatives.
Priesthood: Old antitype with old imperatives – New type with new imperatives.
Sacrifices: Old antitype with old imperatives – New type with new imperatives.
Sabbath: Old antitype with old imperatives – New type with OLD imperatives??? 

Do you see the inconsistency? Sabbatarianism is still holding-on to the old Sabbath that is below. But we celebrate the new Sabbath that is above. 

All these things are part of the old creation: Adam, circumcision, Exodus, Passover, Old Covenant (and canon: OT), Israel, temple, priesthood, sacrifices, Law of Moses, and old creation Sabbath.

All these things are part of the new creation: Christ, heart circumcision of all, new Exodus, new Passover, New Covenant (and canon: NT), the Church, new temple, new priest, new sacrifice, new of Christ law, new creation Sabbath.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;strong&gt;RB: 1. Christ fulfilled that to which the first marriage pointed yet we still practice marriage. 2.

What I meant was that since Christ fulfilled the types 100% (circumcision, Passover, temple, priesthood, etc.), we don’t practice/obey any part of their OT commands.

Greg said: &quot;The relation between type-antitype is 100% new-replacement, not partial old-continuation.&quot;
