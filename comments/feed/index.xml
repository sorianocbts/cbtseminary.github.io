					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the helpful summary Tom. Here is a very helpful collection of resources from the &quot;Covenanter&quot; perspective. By providing historic sources with some explanation, it helpfully shows the difference between theonomy and the original understanding of general equity.

					<description><![CDATA[Labels are necessary but can be dangerous and misleading, causing interpreters to exclude some aspects of the truth. I am Amillenial (In-millenial), partially preterist in that I believe that judgment of A.D 70 foreshadowed the trials and tribulations of the second coming of Christ. (The disciples believed that the destruction of the temple meant the end of the age but they were wrong). However, I believe that Revelation was written after A.D. 70 and is a form of dramatic cyclical progressive parallelism, which is not historicist or futurist but also not essentially idealist.

Since prophecy was given to forewarn the elect so that they would be forearmed to avoid deception, to hyper-spiritualize key elements like the identity of the Antichrist (papal Rome and its Babylonian daughters), is to miss out on the key element of prophecy, and to be a deficient watchman and an uncertain bugler of the battle. So what is my label: &quot;Realistic In-millenialist.&quot;]]></description>
