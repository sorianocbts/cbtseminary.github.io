<p><em>This is part 2 of a blog series by Rex Semrad on Covenant Theology. You can find part 1 <a href="/covenant-theology-the-2lbc-cbts/" data-type="URL" data-id="/covenant-theology-the-2lbc-cbts/">here</a>.</em></p>



<p>There has been an unfortunate amount of confusion regarding the relationship between the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith (1677/1689) and the doctrine of the Covenant of Works. In one sense this is understandable for the following reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Both the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Savoy Declaration state in chapter 7, paragraph 2: “The first covenant made with man was a covenant of works, wherein life was promised to Adam, and in him to his posterity, upon condition of perfect and personal obedience.” The 2LBC omits this paragraph completely, which has led some to the conclusion that the authors of our confession chose not to confess the Covenant of Works.</p>



<p>This conclusion, though understandable, must be rejected if the confession as a whole is rightly understood. If we closely examine the 2LBC, we will find that the omission of this paragraph was made for editorial purposes and was not intended as a rejection of the content of the paragraph.</p>



<p><strong>The Covenant of Works in 2LBC Chapter 6</strong></p>



<p>To begin with, the substance of the Covenant of Works (C o W) is added to chapter 6 of the 2LBC as can be seen in paragraphs 1 &amp; 3.&nbsp; The term C o W is not used, but the doctrine is clearly confessed.</p>



<p><strong>Chapter 6:&nbsp;Of the Fall of Man, Of Sin, And of the Punishment Thereof</strong></p>



<p>1. Although God created man upright and perfect, and <em>gave him a righteous law, which had been unto life had he kept it</em>, <em>and threatened death upon the breach thereof</em>, yet he did not long abide in this honour; Satan using the subtlety of the serpent to subdue Eve, then by her seducing Adam, who, without any compulsion, did willfully transgress the law of their creation, <em>and the command given unto them</em>, in eating the forbidden fruit, which God was pleased, according to his wise and holy counsel to permit, having purposed to order it to his own glory.&nbsp;(italics mine)</p>



<p>The most important thing to note here is that God gave Adam “a righteous law, which had been unto life had he kept it…”&nbsp; We see here that though this arrangement is not explicitly called a covenant in this paragraph, a covenant must be what is being confessed.&nbsp; The very first paragraph of the next chapter of the confession makes this abundantly clear:</p>



<p><strong>Chapter 7:&nbsp;Of God&#8217;s Covenant</strong></p>



<p>1. The distance between God and the creature is so great, that although reasonable creatures do owe obedience to him as their creator, yet <em>they could never have attained the reward of life but by some voluntary condescension on God&#8217;s part, which he hath been pleased to express by way of covenant.</em> (italics mine)</p>



<p>According to the 2LBC, the <em>only</em> way a creature can attain a “reward of life” is by a “voluntary condescension on God&#8217;s part” which is called a covenant.&nbsp; So when we confess that a righteous law would have been unto life had it been kept, we are confessing that this was a covenant.</p>



<p>Before moving on, we must take note of two other points in chapter 6.&nbsp; In paragraph 1, we see that “Adam… did willfully transgress the law of their creation, <em>and the command given unto them</em>…” The authors of the confession are making an important distinction here.&nbsp; A distinction is made between the “law of their creation” and “the command given unto them.” The command not to partake of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was not simply a part of the law of creation, it is a positive law added to it.&nbsp; Positive laws are laws pertaining to specific covenants as opposed to natural law, which is the moral law of God which all men are subject to by creation and nature.</p>



<p>We also see federal headship clearly confessed in 2LBC 6:3 “…by God&#8217;s appointment, standing in the room and stead of all mankind, the guilt of the sin was imputed, and corrupted nature conveyed, to all their posterity descending from them by ordinary generation…”&nbsp; It is not simply by nature that Adam stood as the federal head of all mankind, but specifically by Divine appointment.</p>



<p><strong>The Covenant of Works in 2LBC Chapters 19 &amp; 20</strong></p>



<p>While it seems clear from chapter 6 alone that the 2LBC does not reject the Covenant of Works, chapters 19 &amp; 20 make this conclusion beyond any reasonable doubt. Chapter 19 begins:</p>



<p><strong>Chapter 19: Of the Law of God</strong></p>



<p>1. God gave to Adam a law of universal obedience written in his heart, and a particular precept of not eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil; by which he bound him and all his posterity to personal, entire, exact, and perpetual obedience; promised life upon the fulfilling, and threatened death upon the breach of it, and endued him with power and ability to keep it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have here a most explicit statement of the C o W.&nbsp; It could practically be the answer to a catechism question, “What is the covenant of works?”&nbsp; The only thing missing is federal headship, which we saw confessed in 6:3!&nbsp; The term “covenant” is not used, but we see here again a promise of life that can only be possible by way of a covenant according to 7:1.</p>



<p>But one might object, “We still have not seen the term “Covenant of Works” used. If the authors indeed confessed it, why did they not use the term?”&nbsp; The answer is that they did use the term.</p>



<p><strong>Chapter 20:&nbsp;Of the Gospel, and of the Extent of the Grace Thereof</strong></p>



<p>1. <em>The covenant of works being broken by sin, and made unprofitable unto life</em>, God was pleased to give forth the promise of Christ, the seed of the woman, as the means of calling the elect, and begetting in them faith and repentance; in this promise the gospel, as to the substance of it, was revealed, and [is] therein effectual for the conversion and salvation of sinners. (italics mine)</p>



<p>Here we have the explicit use of the term, and the confession that the covenant of works has been broken. How could we confess that something we don’t believe existed was broken?</p>



<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>



<p>The authors of the 2LBC made the editorial decision to move the first mention of the Covenant of Works from chapter 7 to chapter 6.&nbsp; This is quite understandable.&nbsp; It makes perfect sense to begin the chapter on the fall of man with the substance of the covenant from which he fell. Why didn’t they use the term in chapter 6?&nbsp; The covenant of works was not a doctrine that was disputed among them. It was the common parlance of the day. Those reading the confession in the day in which it was written would have recognized what was being confessed.&nbsp; They simply did not feel the need to say “this is the covenant of works” every time they mentioned it.</p>



<p>Unfortunately in our day, broad evangelicalism has forgotten or rejected this important doctrine, something the authors of the 2LBC could not have foreseen. The failures of the modern church must not taint our impressions of those upon whose shoulders we stand. Let us follow in the footsteps of our Particular Baptist forefathers and heartily confess this important doctrine.</p>



<p>For further reading I highly recommend:</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In my years here at CBTS I’ve fielded a plethora of questions from potential students and curious inquirers.&nbsp; If you were to ask me what the most common topic brought up was, my answer would be instantaneous, 1689 Federalism! “What’s the relationship between CBTS and 1689 Federalism?” “Is CBTS 1689 Federalist?” “Does CBTS support 1689 Federalism?”&nbsp; I’ve also seen many ask in various social media contexts, “Is there a 1689 Federalist seminary?” or “What’s the best 1689 Federalist seminary?”&nbsp; I’ve had the desire to address this issue in a series of blog posts for many years now, but I’ve been unable to carve out the time.&nbsp; But now that Dr. Fred Malone is about to reteach Baptist Covenant Theology for us beginning in January, I think it’s high time to address this popular issue publicly.</p>



<p>This post will deal primarily with CBTS &amp; 1689 Federalism (1689Fed from here on out), but I plan to follow this up with some posts regarding Covenant Theology and the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith (2LBC from here on), what it does and does not confess regarding the subject.</p>



<p><strong>Defining Terms</strong></p>



<p>From the way many use the term 1689Fed today, it seems evident that there is a general lack of understanding of exactly what people think the term means or was meant to convey when the term was coined.&nbsp; In early 2013, Pascal Denault published his Master’s thesis under the title, <em>The Distinctiveness of Baptist Covenant Theology, A Comparison Between Seventeenth Century Particular Baptist and Paedobaptist Federalism</em>. We owe a great debt to the author for bringing to light a wealth of information about how the Particular Baptists in the era of the writing of our confession framed their covenant theology, especially in contrast to their Paedobaptist brethren. A plethora of information that had literally been lost for centuries was brought to light in a most refreshing and enlightening way.</p>



<p>I don’t remember the date, but shortly after this publication the website, 1689federalism.com was created by our brother Brandon Adams. I don’t know if Brandon expected the catchy term to gain both acceptance and notoriety as it has, but it’s become a buzzword among Calvinistic Baptists in a way I’ve never before observed.&nbsp; The site was (and still is) extremely helpful with a number of compelling videos and helpful charts laying out both the commonalities and distinctions between the Covenant Theology of the 17<sup>th</sup> Century Baptists and other systems like Paedobaptist Covenant Theology, Dispensationalism, and New Covenant Theology.</p>



<p>Though it is no longer found on the website, at one time there was also a chart comparing 1689 Federalism to 20<sup>th</sup> Century Reformed Baptists.&nbsp; I believe the terms used in this distinction were well meant, and in one sense accurate, but time has shown that they could be easily misunderstood.&nbsp; This is the sense in which they are accurate.&nbsp; What has become known as 1689Fed today is indeed an expression of the covenant theology espoused by the majority of those who originally subscribed to the 2LBC.&nbsp; What was termed 20<sup>th</sup> Century Reformed Baptists is an accurate expression of the covenant theology taught by many Reformed Baptist pastors over the last 40 years. As I noted, this terminology is no longer found on the website, but I still find people making this distinction regularly today.</p>



<p>That being said, I think the terms have been misunderstood by many to mean something I’m quite sure they were never meant to convey.&nbsp; It’s far too common now to see people use the term 1689Fed as though it means the covenant theology actually confessed in the 2LBC.&nbsp; This then leads to the false conclusion that those who might be called 20<sup>th</sup> Century RBs do not fully subscribe to the 2LBC, or at least not properly so.<a href="#_edn1">[i]</a> This has had the very discouraging result of a number of faithful, seasoned, and fully confessional Reformed Baptist men being falsely branded as less than confessional.</p>



<p>There are some facts that if understood should clear up this misapprehension.</p>



<p>1. The 2LBC does not even begin to lay out the entire system of covenant theology held by its authors and original subscribers.&nbsp; The fact is that there is nothing at all written in chapter 7, “Of God’s Covenant” that any Reformed Paedobaptist should not be willing to confess!&nbsp; The purpose of the Confession was not to lay out all the ways the Baptists differed from their paedobaptist brethren with regard to covenant theology.&nbsp; In fact, it was quite the opposite.&nbsp; The confession was published in order to demonstrate the orthodoxy of the churches who subscribed to it. So, while they did confess the ways in which they differed from their brethren in the areas of the sacraments and ecclesiology, the vast majority of the confession focuses on the doctrine commonly confessed with them.</p>



<p>2. While the covenant theology now known as 1689Fed is indeed reflective of what can be seen to be the majority view in the 17<sup>th</sup> Century among Particular Baptists, it was not universal among them.&nbsp; There were some in that day who held to something more akin to what is now ascribed to 20<sup>th</sup> century Reformed Baptists.</p>



<p>3. Even those with the majority view were not unanimous in the way they viewed particular aspects of covenant theology and the terminology they chose to use. <em>From Shadow to Substance: The Federal Theology of the English Particular Baptists (1642-1704)</em> by Dr. Sam Renihan is a must read for every Reformed Baptist.&nbsp; The author provides a goldmine of detail regarding the covenant theology of our Baptist forefathers and is particularly gifted in helping the reader understand the terminology of the day.<a href="#_edn2">[ii]</a></p>



<p>4. The men who are commonly lumped together as 20<sup>th</sup> Century Reformed Baptists differ from each other in a number of aspects of their covenant theology. In addition, the men of our day who are known as 1689 Federalists, though they are in agreement on the majority of issues, also differ on some finer points, such as the nature of the promise of life in the Mosaic Covenant.</p>



<p>5. The terms “substance and administration” with regard to the covenants has been used by some baptists both in the 17<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> century.&nbsp; Since this is the terminology used by many paedobaptists to identify the OT covenants with the covenant of grace, many have assumed that the baptists who retained that terminology were using it in the same way.&nbsp; That is not always the case.<a href="#_edn3">[iii]</a> (I’ll need to flesh this out a bit more in a later post.)</p>



<p>6. The manner in which the 17<sup>th</sup> century Particular Baptists differentiated between <em>a</em> covenant of works and <em>a</em> covenant of grace has been a matter of great confusion.&nbsp; Modern 1689 Federalists have adopted it, but it sounds very strange to the ears of many who have only ever used the terminology covenant of works for <em>THE</em> covenant of works. (Lord willing, I’ll address this more fully in a later post as well.)</p>



<p><strong>CBTS &amp; 1689 Federalism</strong></p>



<p>With this necessary foundation laid, I want to say a little about the relationship of CBTS to 1689 Fed. I think many people get confused, because we have two visiting professors who are commonly associated with 1689Fed (Dr. Sam Renihan &amp; Dr. Richard Barcellos), while our two most primary professors (Dr. Sam Waldron &amp; Dr. Fred Malone) are commonly lumped in with 20<sup>th</sup> Century Reformed Baptists. I will do my best to clear this up.</p>



<p>Dr. Waldron is first and foremost a systematician. Systematic Theology is his forte, and he has written very little with regard to covenant theology. While it is true that he has not embraced 1689Fed, I would say that he has much in common with the system.&nbsp;He has always held the substance of the Covenant of Works, now embraces the terminology, and believes this doctrine to be a foundational support to a right understanding of the doctrine of justification.He has never held to the idea that the OT covenants were simply administrations of the covenant of grace.&nbsp; He recently embraced the teaching that the New Covenant is the covenant of grace.&nbsp; He is the President of CBTS and was in hearty agreement with inviting Dr. Sam Renihan to teach the Origins of Baptist Covenant Theology for us. And on a personal note, though he knows well that I embrace 1689Fed, he asked me to teach on chapter 7 of our confession for the adult SS class here at GRBC. Finally, after reading&nbsp;<em>The Mystery of Christ, His Covenant, and His Kingdom</em>, he told me that he was greatly benefitted by it.</p>



<p>Dr. Fred Malone teaches our Reformed Baptist Covenant Theology class, as I mentioned above.&nbsp; Last time he taught the class live was in January of 2015.&nbsp; I was a student at that module and I asked him what his opinion of 1689Fed was. His answer was simply that he was aware of the website but had not taken the time to examine it. That being said, though he does not use all the same terminology as 1689Fed in the same way they do, having taken his class I can say that I don’t see anything he teaches as incompatible with it.&nbsp; Both Pascal Denault’s book and the Coxe/Owen volume were assigned reading for the class, and he said nothing in the class as corrections or exceptions to their content. Here is the list of assigned and recommended texts for his class next semester:</p>



<ul><li>Samuel E. Waldron. <em>A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith </em>Chapter 7 “On the Covenants”</li><li>Nehemiah Coxe. <em>Covenant Theology from Adam to Christ</em>.</li><li>Samuel Bolton. <em>True Bounds of Christian Freedom</em></li><li>Samuel D. Renihan. <em>The Mystery of Christ, His Covenant &amp; His Kingdom</em></li><li>Richard C. Barcellos. <em>Getting the Garden Right</em></li><li>Samuel D. Renihan. <em>From Shadow to Substance: The Federal Theology of the English Particular Baptists (1642-1704)</em></li><li>Fred A. Malone. <em>The Baptism of Disciples Alone: Revised and Expanded</em></li><li>Pascal Denault. <em>The Distinctiveness of Baptist Covenant Theology</em></li></ul>



<p>As you can see from the above list, Dr. Malone isn’t against what is now known as 1689Fed.&nbsp; This really shouldn’t be surprising to anyone since he wrote a recommendation for Denault’s book, as did Dr. Tom Nettles who also teaches for us.</p>



<p>To sum things up, CBTS is a confessional seminary holding to the 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith.&nbsp; While this does not infer that 1689 Federalism is the official covenantal position of the seminary, you would be hard pressed to find things taught here that are not compatible with the system.&nbsp; On the other hand, we stand firmly against the idea that one must adopt 1689Fed in order to be fully confessional.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Forgive me if this seems out of place, but I can’t help myself. I simply cannot say anything about covenant theology without recommending Sam Renihan’s book, <em>The Mystery of Christ</em>. Sam is an extremely humble young man, so he probably cringes when he hears me say this, but I am convinced that <em>The Mystery of Christ</em> is the best book on covenant theology ever written. I would have given my left arm to have such a work twenty-some years ago when I was trying to make heads or tails of covenant theology and was limited almost exclusively to paedobaptist works.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator"/>



<p><a href="#_ednref1">[i]</a> &nbsp;This idea is actually directly contradicted in the FAQ section of the 1689Fed website: <a href="http://www.1689federalism.com/faq/does-the-2nd-london-baptist-confession-only-permit-1689-federalism/">http://www.1689federalism.com/faq/does-the-2nd-london-baptist-confession-only-permit-1689-federalism/</a></p>



<p><a href="#_ednref2">[ii]</a> Assuming the reader has already read the Coxe/Owen volume, <em>Covenant Theology from Adam to Christ</em>, I highly recommend rereading it after reading <em>From Shadow to Substance</em>.&nbsp; Much of Coxe was mysterious to me upon first reading, but after reading Renihan, I went back to Coxe with a great deal of profit.&nbsp; These interactive outlines are also helpful: <a href="http://www.1689federalism.com/interactive-outline-of-coxe-on-the-covenants/">http://www.1689federalism.com/interactive-outline-of-coxe-on-the-covenants/</a> &nbsp;<a href="http://www.1689federalism.com/interactive-outline-of-john-owens-exposition-of-hebrews-86-13/">http://www.1689federalism.com/interactive-outline-of-john-owens-exposition-of-hebrews-86-13/</a></p>

<p>Johnson, Jeffrey. <a href="http://amzn.to/2vxSX9C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>He Died for Me: Limite</em></strong><strong><em>d Atonement &amp; the Universal Gospel</em></strong></a>. Conway, AR: Free Grace Press, 2017.  201 pp.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Critical Evaluation (Continued)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>An alternate solution</strong></span></p>
<p>While I commend Johnson for defending the free and well-meant offer of the gospel, I am convinced that he is going about it the wrong way.  The key to understanding the well-meant offer is not found by delving into the secret, decretive will of God and asking, “for whom did Christ die?”  Rather, it is found in rightly upholding and believing the preceptive will of God.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Quite simply, what God commands, He actually desires.  When God commands all men everywhere to repent and believe the gospel, He actually wants all men everywhere to repent and believe the gospel.  When Jesus Christ invites sinners to come to Him, He really desires that they come to Him.  The rationalism of the Hyper-Calvinist declares that this cannot be so, because we cannot say that God wants what He has not decreed.  But to defend God’s decretive will by denying His preceptive will is not biblical.</p>
<p>Allow me to illustrate.  God commands all men to be faithful to their wives.  So if a man came to us and asked, “Does God want me to cheat on my wife?” we would emphatically reply, “Of course not!  He has commanded you not to commit adultery.”  We would not say, “Let’s wait and see.  If God has decreed that you will cheat on your wife, you will, and then we will know that He wanted you to.”  The fact that God’s decree is His will cannot be allowed to negate the fact that God’s command is His will.  The implications of the idea that God does not really desire what He commands can be devastating and we must never allow ourselves to be guilty of doing this.</p>
<p>So, in the very same way that I can tell every pregnant woman that God <em>earnestly desires</em> that she refrain from murdering her baby at Planned Parenthood, I can tell anyone and everyone that God <em>sincerely desires</em> that they repent of their sins and trust in the Lord Jesus Christ for the eternal welfare of their souls.  We should not shrink back for a moment from the statement that God desires all men to be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth. But neither should we shrink back from the truth that God has by His decree determined that most will not do so.  Perhaps in eternity God will give us some insight as to how these two truths coincide, but for now, it is our place to hold them both in tension, for both truths are revealed in the Word of God.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>I am not proposing two opposing wills in God.  We must be careful not to speak of God as if He were schizophrenic. William Perkins explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">There is but one will in God. Yet God does not equally will all things, but wills all things in divers respects. He does not will and nil the same thing. He wills the conversion of Jerusalem, in that he approves it as a good thing in itself. In that he commands it, and exhorts men to repent and believe and be converted. It is also good in that he gives them the outward means of their conversion. But, He does not will it in that he did not decree effectually to work their conversion. For God approves he may require many things which nevertheless for just causes known to himself, he will not do. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>
<p>Clearly, there are a number of points with which I am in disagreement with Johnson, and I cannot accept many of his arguments or his primary thesis.  A more revealing title for the book would be <em>He Died for the Reprobate</em>.  Yet I would not hesitate to recommend this book (with obvious qualifications) to anyone who already has a solid understanding of the doctrines of grace.  While I do not think Johnson’s arguments against John Owen’s <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a> view of particular redemption actually hold water, I still think it is good for them to be heard.  Too many Calvinists today have never been exposed to anything but Owen’s view, and Johnson does a fantastic job of introducing his readers to viewpoints of other Reformed theologians.</p>
<p>I think many Calvinists who read this book will have a gut reaction to declare that Johnson is not really Reformed, that he is an Amyraldian or four-point Calvinist, and simply dismiss him out of hand.  I strongly exhort anyone with this temptation to refrain from such conclusions!  Just because Johnson rejects John Owen’s method of defending the doctrine of limited atonement does not mean he rejects the doctrine itself.  He is not outside the Reformed tradition.  A perusal of the original sources the he quotes for support will make this clear.  Though they may not all support his thesis as much as he would like, he is not abusing them.  Anyone still not convinced need only to read p. 402 in vol. 3 of Bavinck’s <em>Reformed Dogmatics</em>.</p>
<p>Johnson is a talented writer as well as a faithful minister of the Word of God.  <em>He Died for Me</em> has been the catalyst that caused me to give more thought than ever before to the atonement we have in Christ Jesus, and for that I am forever in his debt.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> Deut. 29:29.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref2" name="_ftn2">[2]</a> For an excellent discussion of this point, see John Calvin, <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em>, Book 1, Chapter 8, Section 3.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref3" name="_ftn3">[3]</a> William Perkins, <em>A Treatise of God’s Free Grace and Man’s Free Will</em>, (2012, Puritan Publications) Kindle Edition.</p>
<p><a href="#_ftnref4" name="_ftn4">[4]</a> Johnson brings up Owen sixty times in this book.  It is clear that one of his primary goals is to reject Owen’s view of the atonement.</p>

<p>Johnson, Jeffrey. <a href="http://amzn.to/2vxSX9C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>He Died for Me: Limite</em></strong><strong><em>d Atonement &amp; the Universal Gospel</em></strong></a>. Conway, AR: Free Grace Press, 2017.  201 pp.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Critical Evaluation (Continued)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>A test case</strong></span></p>
<p>It will be helpful, I think, to take a moment to apply Johnson’s ideas directly to one of the texts he believes supports his thesis, and see how it fits.  1 John 2:2 is the text we will examine, but we will include verse 1 for added context.  “My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; <sup>2</sup> and He Himself is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also for those of the whole world.”</p>
<p>Notice first, John is offering comfort and encouragement to his little children, that if (and when) they sin, they have an Advocate (intercessor, mediator) with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.  In order to strengthen this consolation further, John reminds them of one of the primary aspects of Christ’s advocacy on their behalf:  He is the propitiation for their sins.  What is more comforting when we have sinned than bringing to remembrance the truth that Jesus Christ Himself is the propitiation for our sins?  The wrath of God for our sins has been turned away from us by the atoning sacrifice of His Son on our behalf.</p>
<p>John adds that Christ is not the propitiation for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world.  Now, if Johnson is correct, what John is saying is that Christ has not only propitiated the wrath of God against the sins of His people, but has also turned the wrath of God away from everyone in the world.  The manner in which He has turned away the wrath of God against the whole world is that He is an effectual propitiation only for the elect, but He is also a sufficient but ineffectual propitiation for the reprobate.</p>
<p>My question is this: how does the additional information that Christ has also sufficiently though ineffectually turned the wrath of God away from the reprobate bring any consolation to John’s dear little children?  Johnson says, “The fact that it can be said to all that Christ ‘died for our sins’ gives the elect the inward assurance that the promise of forgiveness includes them” (114). But I beg to differ.  I cannot fathom how believing that Christ died not only for the elect, but also ineffectually for the reprobate can bring inward assurance to the elect that forgiveness of sins includes them.  How does the idea that Christ also died for those who still suffer eternally for their sins provide any comfort?  No, the comfort of Christians is the sure and certain knowledge that they have come to Christ who has appeased the wrath of God in their behalf and in behalf of all who will ever come to Him, and He will never cast them away. <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a></p>

<p>Johnson, Jeffrey. <a href="http://amzn.to/2vxSX9C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>He Died for Me: Limite</em></strong><strong><em>d Atonement &amp; the Universal Gospel</em></strong></a>. Conway, AR: Free Grace Press, 2017.  201 pp.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Critical Evaluation (Continued)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>The well-meant offer of the gospel</strong></span></p>
<p>Johnson spends eleven pages on what he calls The Theological Argument for Universal Sufficiency (133-143). While statements like, “And if we are commissioned to call all to repentance and faith in the gospel, then there must have been a sufficient provision made for all, or otherwise God is commanding reprobates to place their faith in an empty promise” (141) are not troubling if understood in the sense that Owen does (<a href="/a-critical-review-of-he-died-for-me-limited-atonement-the-universal-gospel-part-4-of-7/">part 4</a>), it becomes a problem when we realize that for Johnson, sufficient provision demands that Christ died for all.  He asks, “…how can we truthfully call all people to [the] gospel of Christ if Christ did not die for all people?” (135).</p>
<p>First of all, I would argue that the idea that coextensive provision is necessary for a genuine, sincere offer is false.  Roger Nicole illustrates this point: “For instance, advertisers who offer some objects on the pages of a newspaper do not feel that honesty in any way demands of them to have a stock coextensive with the circulation figures of the newspaper.  Really, the only requisite for a sincere invitation is this—that if the conditions be fulfilled, that which is offered will actually be granted.”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> In gospel proclamation we do not tell all men Christ died for them, but we urge all men to come to Christ with the sure and certain promise that every sinner who comes to Him in faith will find a perfect, sufficient and effectual Savior who will never cast him out.</p>
<p>Perhaps a more important point is that <strong>I do not believe Johnson’s solution actually solves his own problem</strong>.  <span style="font-size: large;"><strong><em>If</em></strong></span> we cannot truthfully call all people to the gospel of Christ if Christ did not die for all people,<strong> <em><span style="font-size: large;">then</span> how</em> can we truthfully call all people to the gospel of Christ if Christ only died for all people in an organic manner, but His death is only ever made effectual in those who were already joined to him in federal union at the time of His death?</strong></p>
<p>Johnson’s perceived need to tell all men that Christ died for them is not shared by many of his fellow Moderate Calvinists.  In his notes on Edward Fisher’s <em>The Marrow of Modern Divinity</em>, Thomas Boston is careful to explain that when Fisher says “Christ is dead for you” he does not mean “Christ died for you.”  “Christ is dead for you” means that Christ is available to you, that if you turn to Him in faith you will most assuredly find a sufficient and effectual Savior.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a> He also makes this explicit statement, “Our Lord Jesus Christ died not for, nor took upon him the sins of, all and every individual man, but he died for, and took upon him the sins of, all the elect, (John 10:15, 15:13, Acts 20:28, Eph 5:25, Titus 2:14), and no other doctrine is here taught by our author touching the extent of the death of Christ.”<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Andrew Fuller urged preachers to take no regard to the secret things of God, such as particular redemption, when freely offering the gospel:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">There is no contradiction between this peculiarity of design in the death of Christ, and a universal obligation on those who hear the gospel to believe in him, or a universal invitation being addressed to them. If God, through the death of his Son, have promised salvation to all who comply with the gospel; and if there be no natural impossibility as to a compliance, nor any obstruction but that which arises from aversion of heart; exhortations and invitations to believe and be saved are consistent; and our duty, as preachers of the gospel, is to administer them, without any more regard to particular redemption than to election; both being secret things, which belong to the Lord our God, and which, however they be a rule to him, are none to us. If that which sinners are called upon to believe respected the particular design of Christ to save them, it would then be inconsistent; but they are neither exhorted nor invited to believe any thing but what is revealed, and what will prove true, whether they believe it or not. He that believeth in Jesus Christ must believe in him as he is revealed in the gospel, and that is as the Saviour of sinners. It is only as a sinner, exposed to the righteous displeasure of God, that he must approach him.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>When Johnson asks, “[I]f Christ’s death is not sufficient for the salvation of all people, then on what basis does God promise to forgive all people?” (136), he is making a mistake.  God nowhere promises to forgive all people!  God promises to forgive all who come to Christ and trust in Him alone for their eternal salvation.  Even if we take our cue from John 3:16, this is plain to see.  For God loved the mass of wicked fallen sinners so much that He sent His only begotten Son, so that every single one of those wicked sinners who trusts in Him will not perish, but have everlasting life.  What makes this a genuine, bona fide offer that does not “push the dishonesty onto God” (137), is not that Christ died for all men in some manner that is only effectual for some of them, but that it is a promise that has never and shall never fail!  Every sinner who comes to Christ will be saved, and we have no need to delve into the secret will of God to make that declaration, or to call men to Christ in honesty and sincerity.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Critical Evaluation (Continued)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Owen forgot about election?</strong></span></p>
<p>Two of Johnson&#8217;s statements are particularly well suited to make the jaws of his readers drop to the floor: &#8220;However, there is something Owen did not consider. In fact, it is a crucial element that changes everything. Owen failed to factor in the one gift that God has given His people that was not procured by the death of Christ&#8212;election&#8221; (172), and then, &#8220;Though Owen was right when he said faith was procured by the death of Christ, he did not consider that the cross did not procure election, which is the reason that the saving benefits of the cross, including faith, are only efficaciously applied to the elect in time&#8221; (176).&nbsp; But once I got past the shock of someone accusing John Owen of failing to consider <em>election</em> in his arguments for why the atonement of Christ is only effectual <em>for the elect</em>, I gave the idea a great deal of thought.&nbsp; But I came to the opposite conclusion.</p>
<p>Rather than failing to consider the role of election that Johnson sees in making the atonement effectual to the elect, Owen could not fathom any sense in which there could be an atonement apart from election.&nbsp; Johnson may be comfortable with the idea that &#8220;In its relationship to Christ as Mediator the atonement is universal, but with reference to his work as his people&#8217;s Surety, his redemption is particular&#8221; (179, 180), but Owen never could be.&nbsp; Owen recognized first and foremost, that Christ&#8217;s sacrifice was the Mediator of the Covenant of Grace offering Himself up for those whom the Father had given Him.&nbsp; While His mediatorial sacrifice certainly had repercussions on the reprobate, there is no sense in which that sacrifice could be considered to be made &#8220;for them.&#8221;</p>
<p>For Johnson, <em>(actual) universal sufficiency</em> means that Christ died for all men.&nbsp; So in that sense he is correct when he states, &#8220;Owen could not embrace (actual) universal sufficiency because that which brings about the application of the atonement&#8212;saving faith&#8212;was effectually procured by the death of Christ&#8221; (117).&nbsp;&nbsp; But that was not Owen&#8217;s only argument against the idea of Christ dying for all men. It was not even his primary argument, as is evident: &#8220;it is denied that the blood of Christ was a sufficient price and ransom for all and every one, not because it was not sufficient, but because it was not a ransom.&#8221;<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> For Owen, all things associated with the death of Christ&#8212;ransom, satisfaction, reconciliation, redemption&#8212;could only be understood biblically if they were comprehended with direct reference to the elect.&nbsp; The Bible everywhere speaks of Christ&#8217;s death as substitution, satisfaction, reconciliation and redemption with regard to His chosen people, the church.&nbsp; But the Bible nowhere speaks of Christ as a sufficient but ineffectual Surety, Mediator or Savior for the non-elect.&nbsp; Scripture is equally silent regarding a sacrifice that is a sufficient but ineffectual ransom, a sufficient but ineffectual propitiation or a sufficient but ineffectual redemption.&nbsp; Johnson is correct when he asserts, &#8220;according to Owen, there cannot be two intentions for the death of Christ&#8212;one intention designed to save the elect and another intention designed to provide a way of salvation for the non-elect&#8221; (63, 64).&nbsp; Owen could not fathom a second intention designed to provide a way of salvation for the non-elect, because Scripture nowhere reveals such an idea.</p>
<p>Before moving on from the subject of John Owen, we must recognize that he did not altogether deny the sufficiency of Christ&#8217;s sacrifice to pay for the sins of all men.&nbsp; Johnson admits as much on page 119.&nbsp; But what is not found in Johnson&#8217;s book is the fact that Owen was actually in agreement that Christ&#8217;s sacrifice is sufficient and it does have implications for the indiscriminate publication of the gospel.</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">Now, this fulness and sufficiency of the merit of the death of Christ is a foundation unto two things:&#8211; First, The general publishing of the gospel unto &#8220;all nations,&#8221; with the right that it hath to be preached to &#8220;every creature,&#8221; Matt. xxviii. 19; Mark xvi. 15; because the way of salvation which it declares is wide enough for all to walk in. There is enough in the remedy it brings to light to heal all their diseases, to deliver them from all their evils. If there were a thousand worlds, the gospel of Christ might, upon this ground, be preached to them all, there being enough in Christ for the salvation of them all, if so be they will derive virtue from him by touching him in faith; the only way to draw refreshment from this fountain of salvation.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And again,</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #333333;">Secondly, That the Scripture sets forth the death of Christ, to all whom the gospel is preached [unto], as an all-sufficient means for the bringing of sinners unto God, so as that whosoever believe it and come in unto him shall certainly be saved. Thirdly, What can be concluded hence, but that the death of Christ is of such infinite value as that it is able to save to the utmost every one to whom it is made known, if by true faith they obtain an interest therein and a right thereunto, we cannot perceive. This truth we have formerly confirmed by many testimonies of Scripture, and do conceive that this innate sufficiency of the death of Christ is the foundation of its promiscuous proposal to elect and reprobate</span>.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p></blockquote>
<p>So, we find disagreement with Johnson, not in his insistence that Christ&#8217;s sacrifice must be sufficient for all if we are indiscriminately to preach the gospel to all men, but rather in his insistence that in order for Christ&#8217;s sacrifice to be sufficient for all men, it must have in some manner been offered for all men.</p>

<p>Johnson, Jeffrey. <a href="http://amzn.to/2uStkPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>He Died for Me: Limited Atonement &amp; the Universal Gospel</em></strong></a>. Conway, AR: Free Grace Press, 2017.  201 pp.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Critical Evaluation (Continued)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Exegesis</strong></span></p>
<p>An extremely disappointing aspect of <em>He Died for Me</em> was Johnson’s exegesis, or rather, the lack thereof.  For instance, under the heading <em>The Exegetical Argument for Universal Sufficiency</em>, he states: “Though every proof text will be highly contested, such as 1 Timothy 2:4–6, Hebrews 2:9–10, and 1 John 2:2, I’m not sure how much closer the apostle Paul could have been in making a distinction between sufficiency and efficacy when he claimed that Christ “is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe” (1 Tim. 4:10)” (130). But he does not provide any exegesis for any of these passages.</p>
<p>Instead, Johnson makes the claim that the purpose for the illustration of the brass serpent was to explain how Christ can be the Savior of all people (129, 130), claims that high Calvinists must explain why such terms as <em>all</em> and <em>world</em> do not mean all people (130), and then states that they typically do so by building a case that restricts <em>all</em> and <em>world</em> to the elect (131).  Then he moves on to John 3:15-21.  After a short discussion of why he believes that <em>world</em> in John 3:16 cannot mean the elect alone, he comes to this conclusion: “Both those who hear and believe and those who hear and do not believe have one thing in common—they both heard the universal offer of the gospel. And if they both (believers and unbelievers) heard the offer, it strongly suggests that they both are included in the ‘world’ of the ‘whosoever.’”</p>
<p>Much stands against Johnson’s seemingly assumed interpretations of the four passages he listed.  The limitation of the universal language in these passages is not something artificially imposed by high Calvinists.  Louis Berkhof, whom Johnson repeatedly claims as a moderate Calvinist,<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a> provides solid exegetical arguments for the limited nature of the universal language in each of them in his <em>Systematic Theology</em>. <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a>  And he does not do so by merely equating the world with the elect.  And John Calvin, Johnson’s most quoted moderate Calvinist, would take issue with him on both 1 Timothy 4:10 and 1 John 2:2.</p>
<p>Calvin was far from regarding 1 Timothy 4:10 as proof of sufficiency for all men but efficacy only for the elect.  He did not think the term <em>Savior</em> should be taken in the sense of eternal salvation:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #666666;">To make this more clear, it ought to be understood that this is an argument drawn from the less to the greater; for the word <em>soter</em> is here a general term, and denotes one Who defends and preserves. He means that the kindness of God extends to all men. And if there is no man who does not feel the goodness of God towards him, and who is not a partaker of it, how much more shall it be experienced by the godly, who hope in him? <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>And in reference to 1 John 2:2, Calvin explicitly denies that the Lombardian Formula is suitable to the passage, but declares, “under the word all or whole, he does not include the reprobate, but designates those who should believe as well as those who were then scattered through various parts of the world. For then is really made evident, as it is meet, the grace of Christ, when it is declared to be the only true salvation of the world.” <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>I do not know which surprised me more: that he included Hebrews 2:9-10 when the context so clearly indicates that the everyone for whom Christ tasted death was every one of His brethren, or the fact that he seemed to equate the <em>whosoever</em> of John 3:16 with the <em>world </em>of John 3:16.  The phrase translated “whoever believes” is more literally rendered “every believing one” or “every believer” and therefore cannot be a reference to the reprobate as well as the elect or a reference to the world in general.  The final exegetical issue that I will mention comes from another section of the book.  First Corinthians 15:3, according to Johnson, “implies that Paul had no problem telling everyone that ‘Christ died for our sins” (113).  Paul is not speaking to unbelievers in this passage, but rather to the church for whom Christ died.  There is no reason to assume that Paul was here giving a direct quote of the words he used in preaching the gospel to unbelievers.  The fact that there is not one example in any of the Gospels or the book of Acts of anyone telling unbelievers that Christ died for them strongly suggests that this is not the proper interpretation.</p>

<p><a href="#_ftnref1" name="_ftn1">[1]</a> While I do not fully reject Johnson’s division of Calvinists into Hyper, High, Moderate, &amp; Low, I’m not sure how helpful it really is, and it definitely seems as if his reasoning for declaring some to be Moderate is a bit arbitrary.</p>

<p>Johnson, Jeffrey. <a href="http://amzn.to/2uStkPA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><em>He Died for Me: Limited Atonement &amp; the Universal Gospel</em></strong></a>. Conway, AR: Free Grace Press, 2017.  201 pp.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: xx-large;"><strong>Critical Evaluation</strong></span></p>
<p>There are several helpful aspects to <em>He Died for Me</em>.  Readers will be exposed to many statements from respected Reformed theologians of the past that may surprise them.  I don’t think most Calvinists in our day realize how frequently universal language has been used in the past, even by trusted Reformed men who strongly adhere to the doctrine of particular redemption.  Even the reader who is not persuaded by Johnson’s arguments will be better off for taking the time to think through them.  Thinking deeply upon the doctrine of the redemption we have in Jesus Christ will be a blessed consequence of reading this book.  The portions of the book in which Johnson deals directly with the issue of the atonement with regard to the elect are particularly edifying.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong><em>Idem</em> vs. <em>Tantundem</em></strong></span></p>
<p>That being said, I was not persuaded by Johnson’s arguments, and I find that I must take issue with him on a number of points. The first of these is the way he treats <em>idem</em> as quantitative punishment and <em>tantundem</em> as qualitative punishment with regard to the atonement.  His use of these two Latin terms seems to me to be quite out of step with their historical meaning, especially with regard to the later of the two.  In fact, I cannot understand how the term <em>tantundem</em> can properly mean <em>qualitative</em> at all.</p>
<p>These terms began to be used with reference to the atonement when, in the appendix of one of his books, Richard Baxter took issue with Owen’s <em>Death of Death in the Death of Christ</em>.  Owen responded to Baxter with <em>The Death of Christ, the Price He Paid, &amp; the Purchase He made</em>.  Earlier, Owen had contended with Hugo Grotius, because Grotius had argued that Christ’s sufferings were <em>tantundem,</em> meaning that the Father had to agree graciously to accept a lesser payment than was actually owed.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1">[1]</a>  In the discussion with Baxter, Owen used the terms in this way: “I affirm that he paid <em>idem</em>, that is, the same thing that was in the obligation, and not <em>tantundem</em>, something equivalent thereunto, in another kind.” <a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The usage of these terms to refer to “the same thing” over against “something equivalent” is present in others as well.  Johnson quotes Thomas Manton as saying, “He was to suffer what we were to suffer; if not the idem (quantitative), every way the same, yet the tantundem (qualitative), that which was sufficient to Christ’s ends, that which was to carry a full resemblance with our punishment” (124). The terms in parentheses are added by Johnson, and seem very misleading to me.  In the context, Manton is speaking of the desertion of Christ by the Father, and his point is that though Christ cannot be forsaken by God in the same manner as the damned will be, yet he did “suffer so much of it as his holy person was capable of.” <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3">[3]</a></p>
<p>This is actually quite interesting, because whether or not Christ’s suffering is <em>idem</em> or <em>tantundem</em> really depends on how one looks at it.  Thomas Brooks also uses the terms to mean <em>the thing itself</em> or <em>something equivalent</em> when he argues that in different respects both <em>idem</em> and <em>tantundem</em> may be affirmed.  In respect to the substance, kind or nature of the suffering, it was <em>idem</em> or the same as the sinner should have undergone, for the punishment due to the sinner is death.  However, in terms of the duration of it or the desperation going along with it, Christ’s suffering was <em>tantundem</em>, not the same, but equivalent. <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4">[4]</a></p>
<p>While Johnson’s use of <em>tantundem</em> to mean <em>qualitative</em> is troubling, I must also take issue with his understanding of what Owen meant by <em>idem</em>.  He states: “By framing the argument in such a way, Owen presumed that the degree of pain and suffering inflicted on Christ was quantitatively measured out by the number of sins of those imputed to His account” (117). He then provides a quote from Owen, that in isolation appears to back up this claim.  He seems to be equating Owen’s view with what is sometimes referred to as the commercial view of the atonement, that Christ had to suffer a certain amount for each sin of each of the people for whom He died, so much so that had God elected another man or if one of the elect had committed another sin, He would have had to suffer more.</p>
<p>Johnson should know better than to ascribe such an idea to Owen.   He quotes Charles Hodge: “This is not the doctrine of any Church on earth, and never has been” (123).  Now Hodge may have been ignorant of some Calvinistic Baptist views, but he was certainly well aware of the views of Owen, Turretin, and Perkins.</p>
<p>By <em>idem</em>, Owen did not mean that Christ suffered “so much for so many” as Hodge put it, but that the wages paid were the very wages owed, for the wages of sin is death.  “The idem and very thing threatened in the constitution of the law is death. The terminating of that penalty to the person offending was in the commination, and had it not been relaxed, must have been in the execution; but in the constitution of the obligation, which respects purely the kind of penalty, primarily it was not. ‘Death is the reward of sin,’ is all that is there.”<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5">[5]</a>  As Carl Trueman explains:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="color: #666666;">[W]hen responding to Baxter in <em>Of the Death of Christ</em>, Owen makes the point that the penalty required for sin was death. This is an important point: there is a danger when thinking of Christ’s atonement in terms of satisfaction for debt that one can be led astray into thinking in crudely quantitative terms: sin has accumulated x amount of debt; so the penalty is to be paid in terms of x, where x is analogous to money or property. That is not the model with which Owen is operating: the penalty is not quantitative in such a way; rather, it is perhaps better described as qualitative. It is not that Christ has to pile up a heap of suffering to match the offense human beings have given to God; it is that he has to die. Death is the penalty. <a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6">[6]</a></span></p></blockquote>
<p>So, if what Johnson means when he repeatedly (17, 20, 23, 39, 117, 118, 148, 165, 167, 170) accuses Owen and other high Calvinists of holding a quantitative view of punishment is that they hold some equivalent to the commercial view, he is quite wrong.  If that is not what he means by the quantitative view, then I am completely at a loss for what he really means by either a quantitative or qualitative view.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Introduction</strong></span></p>
<p>Much to my dismay and disappointment, an old error seems to have taken a new hold of the minds of many Calvinists in recent years: the denial of the free and well-meant offer of the gospel.  It is no longer uncommon to hear that God does not desire that every person who hears the proclamation of the gospel should embrace Christ and be saved, or that God’s only purpose in proclaiming the gospel to the reprobate is to harden them and increase their guilt.  Such conclusions are required by the doctrine of limited atonement or particular redemption, are they not?</p>
<p>The answer of the Reformed tradition as a whole and of the Canons of Dort in particular to that question is a resounding “No.” But how can we hold firmly to the two seemingly contradictory doctrines of limited atonement and the free and well-meant offer of the gospel?  Jeffrey Johnson, a Reformed Baptist pastor in Conway, AR, and author of numerous books, has taken up the noble task of helping his readers understand why these doctrines are not actually contrary to one another and can both be embraced simultaneously.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: x-large;"><strong>Summary</strong></span></p>
<p>Johnson is convinced that the key to understanding these things rightly is found in a proper view of the Lombardian Formula, which states that the death of Christ is both limited in its efficacy and universal in its sufficiency (15).  He believes that “High Calvinists” such as Theodore Beza, William Perkins, Francis Turretin and John Owen changed or rejected this formula, and rather than holding to “actual” sufficiency, believed only in “hypothetical” sufficiency.  He is convinced that it is critical to reject the “High Calvinist” view for various reasons, and embrace the “Moderate Calvinist” understanding of the sufficiency of the atonement.  He also does a very good job discussing “Low Calvinist” or four-point Calvinist views and recognizes some strengths in their arguments, before explaining why they must ultimately be rejected.</p>
<p>According to Johnson, high Calvinists like John Owen hold to an <em>idem</em> or quantitative view of the atonement, along with Hyper-Calvinists, and this must be rejected for a <em>tantundem</em> or qualitative view.  This is absolutely essential in order to have an atonement that is actually sufficient for the whole world, and in his opinion, such sufficiency is necessary in order for the offer of the gospel to be well-meant.  He asks, “If Christ did not die for the non-elect, are we lying when we command them to believe in the death of Christ for the salvation of their souls? That is, when we preach the gospel to the non-elect, are we offering them a provision that is not there for them to receive?” (135). Johnson’s strongly implied answer to these questions is “yes.”</p>
<p>So how can it be proper to tell all men that Christ died for them if we still hold to the doctrine of limited atonement, as Johnson does?  He finds the answer to this question in a unique, three-fold understanding of union with Christ: federal union, organic union, and personal union.  Since Christ took true humanity upon Himself, He is therefore in organic union with all humankind.  Because this union is with all mankind, and not merely the elect, and because it is a qualitative atonement rather than a quantitative one, “…the price Christ paid to redeem His chosen people” is “a sufficient price to redeem the whole world” (177).  He concludes, “Thus, universal sufficiency is secured by Christ’s organic unity with humanity” (177).</p>
<p>While organic unity is his basis for the sufficiency of Christ’s death for all men, federal union is the basis for Christ’s death being effectual only to the elect.  The elect were in union with Christ in His death on the cross, their sins were imputed to Him in a qualitative sense, and His death effectually purchased faith for them, and them alone.  “This means that what causes the atonement to be efficaciously applied to the elect and not to the non-elect is not anything inherently in the atonement itself. Rather, its efficacy is determined and restricted to those who were already, due to election, in federal union with Christ as He suffered under the wrath of God” (174).</p>
<p>Personal union occurs when the Holy Spirit regenerates the elect and they exercise the faith Christ purchased for them.  It is this personal union with Christ in which all the benefits of His death are effectually applied.</p>
<p>I would summarize his argument this way.  In order to preach the gospel to all men in sincerity, we must be able to tell all men that Christ died for them.  Christ took true human nature upon Himself, therein uniting Himself with all men, and died a qualitative death in that nature.  For that reason we can tell all men that Christ died for them.  But Christ was uniquely in union with His chosen people in His death, and because of that union, He purchased faith for them.  That faith is then exercised in time as the elect are joined to Christ when the Holy Spirit regenerates them and they experience personal union with Him.  This is how the Lombardian Formula, that Christ’s death was sufficient for all men but efficient only for the elect, solves our dilemma and enables us to proclaim the gospel in sincerity without denying particular redemption.</p>
