					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Dr. Waldron for sharing your notes from the symposium.

I would like to ask a question with reference to Matt 24:29.

It does seem to pose some difficulty in dealing with the way Christ quotes from Joel here.  Peter explains in Acts 2 how this was fulfilled, yet Christ is referring to His return.  Obviously, Christ cannot be referring to the events of Pentecost chronologically here, placing the &quot;great tribulation&quot; before Pentecost.  I would think that Christ is borrowing (I guess it&#039;s not really borrowing since it&#039;s all His word) the figurative language from Joel to describe the upheaval of all things at His return (the book of Revelation would clearly support this idea).  

Could you make some comments that might help clear this up.

Thanks!]]></description>
