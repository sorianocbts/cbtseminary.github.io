					<description><![CDATA[I recently finished reading David Sills book, Reaching and Teaching, and he addresses this issue in his chapter on Techniques and Tools: The Greater Good, CPM and What Only God Can Do.  He says,

&quot;Another controversial aspect of ministry among Muslims relates to the gospel-hostile contexts where they often live.  Because of the danger to Muslims who convert to Christianity, some missionaries encourage them to change little or nothing about their lives when they become Christians.  New Muslim-background Chrisitans often continue going to the mosque, reading the Quran, praying toward Mecca five itmes a day, and even daily repeating the shahada: &#039;I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and that Muhammed is His servant and messenger.&#039;  Additionally, other missionaries in these areas introduce themselves as Muslims since the word simply means, &#039;one who submits.&#039;  They reason that, after all, they submit to God.  However, virtually every hearer of the word &#039;Muslim&#039; understands it to mean &#039;one who submits to Allah according to the teachings of the prophet Mohammed.&#039;  Where is the missionary&#039;s angst, tension, or struggle for balance in all of this?  Increasingly, the greater good mentality erases the tension.  If using these techniques results in the missionary&#039;s ability to stay in the country, stay safe, and get people to pray a prayer, many believe that there is no problem.  The end justifies the means.&quot; [pp. 135-136]

Indeed, this is a critical problem.  I have plans to serve as a missionary to India, where a considerable population is Muslim, though the majority is Hindu (both actually being hostile toward Christians).  I assume this is something I will have to face when on the field, though probably not to the degree of those in majority Muslim contexts.  In short, there is no biblical warrant for blending in or hiding out in a false religion to conceal our true Christian identity.

I&#039;m a bit confused with the video.  Was it endorsing this approach or pointing out the error of it.  It seemed like it was pointing out its error, but I just want to know for sure.

Thanks.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve heard many things about the so-called &quot;insider movement&quot;.  But this resource appears to have something I haven&#039;t heard: the view of the movement by former Muslims, living in the heart of the Islamic world and yet have fully embraced ALL that is revealed in the Bible.  

Thanks for letting us know about this!]]></description>
