					<description><![CDATA[RE: &quot;Since Coxe played a major role in the formulation of the 2nd LCF and since his federalism is clear and in substantial agreement with the federal theology of his day, then, if contemporary, confessional Reformed Baptists confess the things most surely believed among us, then shouldnâ€™t they confess Coxeâ€™s federalism?&quot;

Question regarding the statement above. (Making the assumption that I actually am correct in my understanding of it), don&#039;t the Paedo&#039;s confess a confession that they sometimes take exception to (in part)?

I don&#039;t see it necessary to full agree with absolutely everything a Theologian teaches to find myself in &quot;essential&quot; agreement with something.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sam, me thinks you speak out of both sides of your mouth. Make up your mind, man.
PS: There was a typo in the first posting of this that I left there just to see if any of the Renihans would catch it. I have since fixed it. :-)]]></description>
