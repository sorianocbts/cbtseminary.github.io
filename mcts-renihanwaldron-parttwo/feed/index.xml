					<description><![CDATA[Randy, here is a ntoe  from Dr. Renihan on this.

Both were added to PC under the influence of Benjamin Keach&#039;s son Elias Keach. The father is well-known for his advocacy of singing hymns; he also advocated the practice of laying on hands. He had learned of it during his early days as a General Baptist, and never let go of it when he changed his soteriological views. A minority of English PB&#039;s practiced it, but it became commonplace in the Philadelphia Association through Elias Keach. Cathcart discusses this briefly. You can read Cathcart here: http://books.google.com/books?id=7-zWuEM-qHMC&#038;lpg=PP1&#038;dq=cathcart%20baptist%20encyclopedia&#038;pg=PA266#v=onepage&#038;q&#038;f=false]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Dr. Barcellos,
Great subject - keep the conversation going.  I wonder if any of you Drs. might comment on the two articles added in the Philadelphia Confession both as to their merit and the manner of their inclusion.  Furthermore, if you could direct me to some historical works that would set out the background for the adopting of article 31 &#039;On the Laying on of Hands&#039; it would be appreciated.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Very helpful conversation indeed!  I think that it is important to note that if a man of Dr. Renihan&#039;s caliber does not feel as though he has what it takes to be involved in the formulating of a new confession, than clearly there are none who is able to do so.

And BTW Rich you are an old fuddy-duddy, and we love you for it ;-)]]></description>
