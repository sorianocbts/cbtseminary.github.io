					<description><![CDATA[This is exactly my problem with some of the groups that seem to focus on the Patriarchal family first and Christianity second. Many set the family up as an idol, with the father taking the place of Christ. I am not sure if you, as a man, have read some of the teachings on women&#039;s site affiliated with these groups, but there are many who teach that a husband will answer for his wife&#039;s sins, or that we are accountable to our husbands only, because any word from God will come to us from him (it reminds me of the Mormon&#039;s teaching that a woman only gets into heaven when her husband calls for her).]]></description>
