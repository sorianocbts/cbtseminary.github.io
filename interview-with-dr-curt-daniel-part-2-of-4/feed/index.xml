					<description><![CDATA[Dear Brother Waldron,

 Hyper-Calvinism is older than the issues Daniel raises regarding the ‘offer’, ‘duty-faith’, a supposed ‘restricted common grace’ and conflicting ‘wills to save’ in the Godhead. These are products of post-Gillite thinking. Traditional Hyper-Calvinism is the belief that God decreed and ordained Adam to sin. This was a doctrine Henry Bullinger accused Calvin of holding whilst explaining to him its dangers to Biblical Gospel preaching. Daniel’s definitions of Hyper-Calvinism have arisen from problems posed by New Divinity thinking and Fullerism. Orthodox Gill denied the error that God decreed sin and only stopped using the deceptive term ‘free offer’ when his Liberal contemporaries began to base their ‘free offer’ invitation on universal atonement. As Rippon points out, Gill took no part in the initial duty-faith debate, but no one was more zealous than he in expounding the place of duty in his synergized view of Law and Gospel within one Covenant of Grace. Sadly, those criticizing Gill today on Law, Gospel and the Covenant, separate the inseparable and look on Christian duties as a step between law and grace. 

Concerning common grace or providence, Gill taught that it was universal, but, of course, distinguished between that and saving grace. Nevertheless he taught and practiced that the gospel of God’s saving grace be preached to all men everywhere as the Spirit leads. He also taught that man stands inexcusable on rejecting Christ and is thus doubly condemned (for his Fall and for refusing the gospel).

I have documented Gill at length on these issues in several books and articles but those who are unfamiliar with my works are invited to ask for primary sources.

Yours sincerely in Christ

Dr. George M. Ella]]></description>
