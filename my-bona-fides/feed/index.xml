					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, Pastor Waldron.  I am still learning in this area after decades in a church culture where &quot;youth ministry&quot; was taken for granted.  Your comments about homeschooling in Michigan brought back memories - when we started homsechooling in Michigan in 1991, my wife would tell me to keep my voice down if I brought up something about our son&#039;s day when we were in a public place, lest someone overhear and report us to the authorities.  Maybe we were a little paranoid, but that was the atmosphere 20 years ago.]]></description>
