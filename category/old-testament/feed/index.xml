Some people today who use the word “theonomy” don’t mean anything more than “God’s law” because the etimology of the word theonomy is “theos” which means God, and “nomos” which means law. They only want to affirm that God’s law is supreme over man’s law. And they’re right about that. God’s transcendent moral law is the norm that norms all norms. Governmental laws should always be consistent with God’s law and human law must never violate God’s law.</p>
<p>But in this post, I’ll be using the word “theonomy” in a more technical sense, which is rooted in the historic usage of the term. Theonomy, in the technical sense, teaches that Old Covenant judicial laws are the universal moral standard of civil law for all Gentile nations. The basic presupposition of theonomy is that God gave the judicial law to the nation of Israel as a universal law of perfect justice for all nations because it is a perfect reflection of God’s own moral character. Some of the most prominent early proponents of this kind of theonomy include Greg Bahnsen, Rousas Rushdoony and Gary North. For a discussion of “general equity theonomy,”<span> </span><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pastortomhicks.com/2021/03/16/is-general-equity-theonomy-a-confessional-and-biblical-doctrine/" target="_blank">see here</a>.</p>
<p>I’m convinced that theonomy is unbiblical for a number of reasons.</p>
<h3><em><strong>1. Theonomy has a flawed hermeutic of Old Testament priority.</strong></em></h3>
<p>Theonomy arrives at its conclusions by insisting that particular Old Testament laws persist, unless they are specifically abrogated by the New Testament. But this reads the Bible improperly. Theonomy’s hermeneutic is consistent with paedobaptism, which says that since the New Testament does not abrogate the Old Testament inclusion of infants, then infants must be given the sign of baptism. Theonomy is also consistent with the Old Testament priority<span> </span><a href="https://www.the-highway.com/theonomy-hermeneutic_Irons.html">hermeneutic of dispensationalism</a>, which teaches that the promises God made for Israel cannot be typologically fulfilled in Christ and the church, but must be literally fulfilled in national Israel. But theonomy’s hermeneutic isn’t consistent with<span> </span><a href="https://founders.org/2016/05/26/hermeneutics-new-testament-priority/">the hermeneutic of New Testament priority</a>.</p>
<p>It is true that earlier revelation is vital for understanding the context of later revelation. In that sense, earlier revelation is logically prior to later revelation. But sound hermeneutical principles recognize that later revelation has interpretive priority over earlier revelation. Therefore, when later Old Testament texts explain earlier parts of the Old Testament, we should pay close attention to what the later texts say and allow them to explain and draw out implications of earlier Old Testament texts, making explicit what was only previously implicit. Similarly, when the New Testament explains Old Testament passages of Scripture, the New Testament has priority of interpretation over the Old Testament.</p>
<p>If the New Testament says an Old Testament passage has a particular meaning, we should assign that meaning to the Old Testament passage. The same is true of New Testament letters, which explain the earlier life and work of Jesus Christ in the Gospels.</p>
<p>This is nothing other than what Augustine taught when he said, “The New is in the Old concealed; the Old is in the New revealed.” The light of revelation is brighter as we move toward the end of the Bible (Louis Berkhof,<span> </span><em>Principles of Interpretation</em>, pp. 54, 133, 135, 137). Berkhof says, “The New Testament is implicit in the Old, so the Old is explicit in the new” (135). And “The more perfect revelation of the New Testament illumines the pages of the Old” (137-138).</p>
<p>This isn’t really any different from the way we read any book by a single author. We allow the later parts of a book to interpret the earlier parts of the book. Orthodox theology is rooted in the idea that the one true God authored the whole of the Scriptures. Thus, we should pay close attention to His intended meaning in light of His explanation of His own Word.</p>
<h3><em><strong>2. Theonomy does not account for the fact that Gentile nations are not and never were under the Old Covenant.</strong></em></h3>
<p>The laws peculiar to the Old Covenant do not bind Gentile nations. Gentile nations are under natural law, which is the work of the moral law written on the hearts of all human beings. Romans 2:14 says, “For when the Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature, do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts.”</p>
<p>When God judged the Gentile nations in the Old Testament, He never judged them for violating Old Covenant judicial law. Rather, He judged them for violating His moral law, as summarized in the Ten Commandments (Jerermiah 46-51; Ezekiel 25-32; Amos 1-2; Obadiah; Jonah; Nahum; Habakkuk 2 – a taunt song against the Babylonians for violating God’s moral law; Zephaniah 2).</p>
<h3><em><strong>3. Theonomy doesn’t properly account for the fact that the Old Covenant as a whole, together with all of its laws, has been abolished.</strong></em></h3>
<p>Numerous passages of Scripture teach that the Old Covenant has been fulfilled and abolished with the coming of Christ and the establishment of the New Covenant.</p>
<ul>
<li>Hebrews 7:12 says, “For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.”</li>
<li>Hebrews 7:18 says, “A former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness.”</li>
<li>Hebrews 8:13 says, “In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete.”</li>
<li>Hebrews 10:9 says, “He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.”</li>
<li>Ephesians 2:14-15 says that Christ “has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility, by abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances.”</li>
</ul>
<p>To be clear, the moral law, which is summarized in the Ten Commandments,<span> </span><a href="https://pastortomhicks.com/2020/01/22/are-the-ten-commandments-distinct-from-other-old-testament-law/">has not been abolished</a>. The moral law is rooted in God’s own eternal moral character and is part of the image of God in human beings. Moral aspects of Old Covenant law can never be abolished because they are rooted in nature, not merely in a covenant. But the positive laws of the Old Covenant have been abolished. Theonomy does not properly account for this fact.</p>
<p>Rich Barcellos correctly notes, “The New Testament clearly abrogates the whole Old Covenant, including the Decalogue, as it functioned within the Old Covenant, and yet borrows from its documents as the basis for New Covenant ethics (see for instance 1 Cor. 9:9-10; 14:34; 2 Cor 13:1; Eph 6:2-3, and many other texts)” (<em>In Defense of the Decalogue</em>, p. 68).</p>
<h3><em><strong>4. Theonomy doesn’t acknowledge the existence of positive law in contrast to moral or natural law.</strong></em></h3>
<p>This is related to numbers 2 and 3 above. Natural law is law that people know innately. Romans 2:14-15 is clear that God writes the work of His natural law on the hearts of all men, and Romans 2:21-24 shows that natural law is summarized in the Ten Commandments. Natural law is nothing other than the reflection of God’s moral character in human beings who are made in His image.</p>
<p>Positive law, on the other hand, is law that God posited by way of special revelation in a particular covenant. No one would have known that they ought to obey positive law, unless it had been revealed to them in a biblical covenant.</p>
<p>To give you an example of the distinction between natural/moral and positive law, consider Adam in the Garden of Eden. Adam knew by nature not to worship false gods, not to steal, not to murder, etc. He knew these laws because he was made in the image of God. But Adam would never have known not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, if God had not revealed and commanded that positive law to him in the covenant of works.</p>
<p>To give you another example, Abraham knew by nature that it was wrong to lie to Pharoah about Sarah being his wife. God never had to tell Abraham that lying was wrong because all images of God know it’s wrong to lie, even if they suppress that truth in unrighteousness. But Abraham would never have known that he had to be circumcised except for the fact that God revealed that law to him and commanded him to be circumcised in the covenant of circumcision. Natural law is known innately, but positive law would never be known apart from covenantal revelation.</p>
<p>Natural or moral law transcends all covenants. It’s immutably rooted in the nature and character of God and also in human nature. Fallen human beings suppress their knowledge of natural law, which is why we need Scripture to reassert and clarify it. But even fallen human beings are not completely ignorant of natural law. Positive law, on the other hand, is covenantal, must be specially revealed to be known, and serves a particular purpose within the covenant in which it is given. When covenants change, positive laws change, but moral or natural law does not.</p>
<p>Theonomy does not grasp this crucial distinction. The judicial laws of the Old Covenant are not transcendent moral or natural law, but positive laws, which God commanded in the Old Covenant for a particular reason.</p>
<h3><em><strong>5. Theonomy does not account for the fact that the judicial laws of Israel were only to be practiced in the land of Canaan.</strong></em></h3>
<p>It’s impossible to separate Israel’s judicial law from the land of Canaan. The Old Covenant law was given to the Old Covenant people, who were to keep the law in the Old Covenant land. Deuteronomy 4:14 says, “And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statues and rules that you might do them<span> </span><em>in the land</em><span> </span>that you are going over to possess.”</p>
<p>To give one example, consider the law of the parapet. Deuteronomy 22:8 says, “When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof, that you may not bring the guilt of blood upon your house, if anyone should fall from it.” This judicial law, which is based on blood-guilt, only makes sense because the land of Israel is holy. According to the Old Covenant, blood-guilt defiles the land and results in the expulsion of the people. Deuteronomy 19:10 warns that if blood guilt comes upon the land, the guilt of blood shall be shed upon the people.</p>
<p>While there is certainly an element of perpetual moral law (general equity, “do not murder”) in the law of the parapet, the law itself could only be practiced in the land of Canaan, which is the case for all Old Covenant judicial law.</p>
<h3><em><strong>6. Theonomy misunderstands the reason for the death penalties in Old Covenant judicial law.</strong></em></h3>
<p>Before discussing the death penalty in Old Covenant judicial law, it’s important to understand that the covenant of common grace establishes the death penalty for murder. The death penalty for murder is part of universal moral law. In Genesis 9:6, the Noahic covenant of common grace says, “Whoever sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God made man in his own image.” That is a transcendent moral principle: the punishment must fit the crime. It is<span> </span><em>lex talionis</em>, which is the “law of the same,” often expressed as “an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.” It refers to equal weights and measures in justice. So, the death penalty for murder is moral law.</p>
<p>But other Old Testament death penalties are tied to Old Covenant worship. The term “devoted to destruction” or “devoted to the ban” (Hebrew:<span> </span><em>cherem</em>) involves the death penalty, and it is connected to the purity of the land, holy war, and Old Covenant worship.</p>
<p>Deuteronomy 13:12-16 says:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“If you hear in one of your cities, which the Lord your God is giving you to dwell there, that certain worthless fellows have gone out among you and have drawn away the inhabitants of their city, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods,’ which you have not known, then you shall inquire and make search and ask diligently. And behold, if it be true and certain that such an abomination has been done among you, you shall surely put the inhabitants of that city to the sword, devoting it to destruction, all who are in it and its cattle, with the edge of the sword. You shall gather all its spoil into the midst of its open square and burn the city and all its spoil with fire, as a whole burnt offering to the Lord your God. It shall be a heap forever. It shall not be built again.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is saying that if a city comes under the influence of idolaters, there is to be a careful inquiry, and if it’s found to be true that the city is under the influence of idolaters, then the whole city is to be put to death, together with the cattle.</p>
<p>This law is not simply a matter of moral justice. Verse 16 says that the city becomes a “whole burnt offering to the Lord your God.” It’s an offering to God. This is a law about holy war and Israel’s possession of the holy land. It’s a kind of ceremonial purification.</p>
<p>It also anticipates Judgment Day. The New Testament seems to teach that the death penalties of the Old Covenant are types of eternal condemnation.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:28 says:</p>
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote">
<p>“Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. How much<span> </span><em>worse</em><span> </span>punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace? For we know him who said, “Vengeance is mine; I will repay.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, under the Old Covenant, the penalty for breaking the law was physical death. But the corresponding doctrine of the New Testament is eternal condemnation for those without Christ.</p>
<p>So, the death penalties of the Old Testament are associated with Israel’s unique place in redemptive history. I’m convinced that scholars have shown that all of the death penalties of the Old Covenant are based on the distinctive purposes of the Old Covenant. I recommend Vern Poythress’s book,<span> </span><em>The Shadow of Christ in the Law of Moses</em>, which illustrates this very well. I don’t agree with everything in that book, but it is a good resource to have.</p>
<p>Due to their special character, therefore, it would be unjust to apply Old Covenant death penalties in a Gentile nation. It was perfectly just for Israel to put people to death for all sorts of reasons because God has the right to command the death of any sinner, and He commanded the death of many sinners via the Old Covenant for reasons that were unique to that covenant. But we have no right to implement such penalties in Gentile nations.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the death penalties of the Old Covenant are reflective of the fact that it is a “work for the right to inheritance” covenant. Leviticus 18:5 says, “You shall therefore keep my statutes and my rules; if a person does them, he shall live by them: I am the LORD.” But the new covenant gives the inheritance by grace, not by works. Galatians 3:12-13 denies this works principle under the gospel, “But the law is not of faith, rather, ‘the one who does them shall live by them.’ Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us — for it is written, ‘Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree.&#8217;”</p>
<h3><em><strong>7. Theonomy does not account for the fact that the Old Covenant law was intentionally severe to preserve the line of promise.</strong></em></h3>
<p>The nation of Israel was largely an unbelieving nation. The people needed a severe legal system to chasten them and to preserve them as a nation until Christ would come from them. The severity of Old Covenant judicial law is especially evident in the liberal use of the death penalty. The death penalty was prescribed for false-worship and apostasy (Deut 13:6-11; 17:5), blasphemy (Lev 24:10-16, 23), sabbath-breaking (Num 15:31-36), rebellious sons (Deut 21:18-21), fornication (Deut 22:20-23), adultery (Lev 20:10-11), homosexuality (Lev 20:13) and many other sins. These are very heavy penalties.</p>
<p>Galatians 3:19 explains one of the reasons for such laws: “Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions,<span> </span><em>until</em><span> </span>the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made.” Similarly, Galatians 3:24-25 says, “So, then the law was our guardian<span> </span><em>until</em><span> </span>Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith. But<span> </span><em>now</em><span> </span>that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian.”</p>
<p>Scripture is saying that the severe Old Covenant law was given because of the sins of the people of Israel. It was given to them as a nation, to chasten them, and to act as a deterrent for outward sin, and to keep them from destroying themselves,<span> </span><em>until</em><span> </span>Christ came from them.</p>
<p>The Jerusalem council discussed the fact that some wanted the church to practice circumcision. Acts 15:10 says, “Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?” The covenant of circumcision, and the Old Covenant as a whole, was a heavy legal yoke. Those who try to impose it upon Christians or Gentile nations are heaping a heavy burden upon them. Now that Christ has come, there is no reason for it. The yoke of the Old Covenant has been fulfilled and abolished with the coming of Christ.</p>
<h3><em><strong>8. In each case, when the New Testament applies one of the judicial laws of the Old Covenant, it applies the law’s general equity to the church, and never to the government of a Gentile nation.</strong></em></h3>
<p>This is important because of the hermeneutical principle of New Testament priority. The New Testament teaches us how to interpret and use the Old Testament, which means we need to pay attention to how the New Testament applies Old Covenant judicial laws. You will never find a single New Testament example of an Old Covenant judicial law being applied to a Gentile government.</p>
<p>For example, 1 Timothy 5:17-18 says, “Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, ‘You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,’ and ‘the laborer deserves his wages.” “Do not muzzle the ox while it treads out the grain” is a judicial law that comes from Deuteronomy 25:4. But here, Paul applies the law’s general equity (do not steal) to paying pastors properly in the church. He does not apply it to a Gentile government.</p>
<p>Another example comes from 1 Corinthians 5:13, where Paul is discussing church discipline, and he says, “Purge the evil person from among you.” That’s a judicial law from Deuteronomy 13:5, 17:7, 12, and many other places. In the Old Covenant, “purging the evil person from among you” referred to the death penalty. But in the New Covenant, that judicial law is applied to church discipline, not to the civil death penalty.</p>
<p>So, if we allow the New Testament to teach us how to interpret Old Covenant judicial laws, then we will think of their general equity first as applying to the church, not primarily to Gentile civil governments.</p>
<h3><em><strong>9. To sum up, theonomy’s central mistake is believing that God gave the judicial law of Israel as a universal norm of societal justice for all nations.</strong></em></h3>
<p>Certainly, the moral law of the Old Covenant is a universal norm for all nations. And we ought to use the Old Testament to help us understand God’s moral law. But the positive laws of the Old Covenant had many different functions according to Scripture, and all of them were bound to the unique objectives of the Old Covenant.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the judicial law was tied to the land, to ceremonial worship, and to the preservation of Christ’s line of promise. Some of the judicial laws were simply designed to create a distinct culture for Israel that separated them from the nations. Others were about preserving family lines for the sake of property and inheritance. But all of the positive laws of the Old Covenant were related to the typological character of the Old Covenant and/or to its unique cultural situation and place in redemptive history.</p>
<p>In conclusion, theonomy, in the technical sense of the term is not a biblical idea. Scripture itself refutes the theonomic position, such that in fact, theonomy is not in favor of God’s law at all, but adds to the good law of God positive covenantal precepts that were designed to expire with the coming of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>While this article has been a critique of Theonomy, and I have not outlined a positive biblical theology of civil government, the<span> </span><em>Second London Baptist Confession of Faith</em>, chapter 24, provides a wonderful framework for civil government. I wrote an exposition of that chapter here:<span> </span><a href="https://pastortomhicks.com/2020/04/02/what-is-the-role-of-civil-government/">What is the role of civil government?</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of those who identify as theonomists today refer to themselves as “general equity theonomists,” believing that this identification lands them within the boundaries of Reformed confessional orthodoxy. But if it does, then the term “general equity” needs to be defined the same way the tradition defined it. The technical term “general equity” is used in both the <em>Westminster Confession</em> and the <em>Second London Baptist Confession</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Westminster Confession of Faith</em> 19.4 says, “To them also, as a body politic, He gave sundry judicial laws, which expired together with the State of that people; not obliging any other now, further than the <em>general equity</em> thereof may require.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following the <em>Savoy Declaration</em>, the <em>Second London Baptist Confession of Faith</em> 19.4 says, “To them also he gave sundry judicial laws, which expired together with the state of that people, not obliging any now by virtue of that institution; their <em>general equity</em> only being of moral use.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, while the confessions teach that the “general equity” of the judicial law obliges us, the question remains as to whether “general equity theonomists” mean the same thing by general equity that the confessions mean.  I have found it hard to nail down a single clear definition of “general equity theonomy” that universally describes those who say they hold to it. The term seems to be defined variously and even in contradictory ways. So, rather than focus on the personalities involved in this debate, or cite definitions from a number of different adherents, I want to address what some appear to mean by “general equity theonomy,” which is that the essential or core principles of Old Testament judicial laws have binding authority today. That is, many say that the Old Testament judicial laws have been abrogated, but the essential principles of the judicial laws continue to bind all people today. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em> 1. <strong style="font-size: 22px;">The Historic Meaning of the Term “General Equity”</strong></em></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The question as to the meaning of the term “general equity” is a matter of historical research. I am indebted to Brandon Adams for several of the quotations found in this section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Calvin identifies the term “equity” with moral law. “It is a fact that the law of God which we call the <em>moral law</em> is nothing else than a testimony of <em>natural law</em> and of that conscience which God has engraved upon the minds of men. Consequently, the entire scheme of this <em>equity</em> of which we are now speaking has been prescribed in it. Hence, <em>this equity alone must be the goal and rule and limit of all laws</em>” (<em>Institutes</em> 4.20.15-16, italics in the text are mine).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Calvin’s successor in Geneva, Theodore Beza, wrote, “Although we do not hold to the forms of the Mosaic polity, yet when such <em>judicial laws</em> prescribe <em>equity</em> in judgments, <em>which is part of the decalogue</em>, we, not being under obligation to them insofar as they were prescribed by Moses to only one people, are nevertheless bound to observe them to the extent that they embrace that <em>general equity</em> which should everywhere be in force . . . . Because it follows <em>natural equity</em>, and expounds that <em>perpetual precept of the decalogue</em>, Thou shalt not steal, to this extent all are bound to fulfill them both” (<em>De Haereticis a civili Magistratu puniendis Libellus, </em>Geneva: Robert Stephanus, 1554, pp. 222-23, italics in the text are mine). Beza clearly linked general equity to the decalogue and natural law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>William Perkins wrote, “Judicial laws so far as they have in them the <em>general or common equity</em> of the <em>law of nature</em> <em>are moral</em> and therefore binding in conscience as <em>the moral law</em>” (<em>A Discourse on Cases of Conscience</em> in <em>The Whole Works, </em>London, 1631, 1.520).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thus, the historic meaning of the term “general equity” refers exclusively to the moral law, summarized in the Ten Commandments, which is also revealed in the law of nature. The crucial thing to understand about the general equity of the old covenant judicial law is that the judicial law’s general equity is not first to be found in the judicial laws themselves. If there is general equity in any given old covenant judicial law, it is first found in nature, in creation and conscience, and it is also summarily taught in the Ten Commandments. Therefore, we should not approach old covenant judicial laws to discover distinctive or new principles of law, which are not already revealed in creation, conscience, or the decalogue. Old covenant judicial laws do not establish timeless principles of law; rather, to the extent that there is any general equity in them, it is based on the larger trans-covenantal moral law of nature, which is found outside of those laws.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, if “general equity theonomy” means that the core principles of the judicial laws remain in force, but those principles do not necessarily entail God’s transcendent moral and natural law summarized in the Ten Commandments, then that definition of general equity is contrary to the Reformed confessional tradition. According to the confessional tradition, we must not begin with judicial law to discover principles of general equity. Rather, we must begin with the decalogue and see whether there is any moral or natural law principle in any given judicial law.</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 22px;"><strong></strong></em></p>
<p><em style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>2. The New Testament Use of Judicial Law</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it’s true that the essential core principles of the judicial laws remain binding for us today, then consider how we might interpret Deuteronomy 25:4, which says, “You shall not muzzle an ox when it is treading out the grain.” Without the inspired New Testament commentary on this passage, we might say that a core principle of this passage is “You should allow your animals to feed while they are working.” One way to apply this law might be to say that people should see to it that their hunting dogs always have access to a portion of the meat they kill during the hunt as a matter of biblical law. That would seem to be a reasonable application of the core principle of this judicial law, recognizing that the law itself has been abrogated, but that the essence of it is perpetually binding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet, the New Testament does not derive any such essential principle from Deuteronomy 25:4. Rather, the New Testament finds the eighth commandment embedded in Deuteronomy 25:4, which is an element of transcendent moral and natural law, “You shall not steal” (Ex 20:15). 1 Timothy 5:17-18 says, “Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, ‘You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain,’ and, ‘The laborer deserves his wages.’” The general equity of the law of the muzzled ox is that you must not steal wages from the one who works. Paul saw that the general equity of Deuteronomy 25:4 is nothing other than the eighth commandment, which means that churches should pay their pastors. The same general equity of Deuteronomy 25:4 would apply to refusing to use unjust weights and balances, to forbidding customers from stealing from merchants, merchants from stealing from customers, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, any version of “general equity theonomy,” which does not look for prior transcendent moral law within the judicial law, which is summarized in the decalogue and/or revealed in nature, uses a hermeneutic contrary to the New Testament. The issue at stake is the controls on our interpretation and application of judicial law.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em style="font-size: 22px;"><strong>3. The Way to Find and Apply General Equity of Judicial Law</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take Deuteronomy 22:8 as an example. It says, “When you build a new house, you shall make a parapet for your roof, that you may not bring the guilt of blood upon your house, if anyone should fall from it.” Someone wrote, “We are not morally required to build a parapet around our roof line because we don’t go up there. But general equity would require a rail around your second story deck.” In this instance, the application of general equity theonomy seems to keep tightly to the essential core principles of the judicial law in question. Not a roof, but a second story deck. Not a parapet, but a railing. It’s not the particulars of the law that are binding, but the essential principles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it’s crucial to understand that the general equity of the law of the parapet isn’t merely a matter of the essential principles of that particular judicial law. The general equity of the law of the parapet is nothing other than the sixth commandment, “You shall not murder” (Ex 20:13). Does the law’s general equity require a railing around a second story deck to protect the lives of people who go up there? Absolutely. But railings on second story decks are not required because of the law of the parapet itself. Rather, general equity requires a railing on a second story deck because of the transcendent moral law, summarized in the decalogue, which stands behind the law of the parapet: “You shall not murder.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Understood properly, the general equity of the law of the parapet requires us to protect other people’s lives, and not merely do what is expedient, cheaper, or more convenient for ourselves. The general equity of the law of the parapet applies in a number of circumstances. People who use guns should practice gun safety principles. If you have a deadly illness, take precautions not to spread it to others as far as it depends on you. Salt your sidewalks after an ice storm. Drive safely so as not to endanger others. Don’t leave live electrical wires exposed in your home. The sixth commandment requires that you not be concerned merely for yourself, but must always live so as to protect the lives of other people. That is the general equity of the law of the parapet, the sixth commandment, “do not murder.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em><strong>Conclusion</strong></em></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In conclusion, any understanding of the term general equity, which neglects the decalogue, or natural law revealed in creation or conscience, as the essence of general equity is not accurately defining the term according to its historic and confessional sense. Any version of general equity theonomy that does not look for a moral law that transcends Old Testament judicial law but instead sees Old Testament judicial law as itself a subset of moral law that remains binding is not following the example of the New Testament.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The greatest mistake of such a hermeneutic is that it does not begin with the universal transcendent norms of natural and moral law, summarized in the Ten Commandments, seeking to find those moral principles within judicial law. Rather, it begins with the judicial laws themselves and tries to uncover the essential principles within those laws, wrongly assuming they are all moral, in order to apply them universally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: large;">Are believers in Christ required to obey any part of Old Testament law? Both Dispensationalists and proponents of New Covenant Theology, or Progressive Covenantalism, as one version of it has come to be called, simply say “no.” In their view, the laws of the Old Testament are fulfilled and abrogated in Christ. Believers are only required to obey the “law of Christ,” which is taught in the commands of the New Testament alone. That’s a simple hermeneutic that draws a sharp line between the testaments and tells believers they don’t have to obey any Old Testament law. One of the major problems with this perspective is that New Testament authors seem to assume the authority of the Old Testament in matters of certain kinds of law. Another problem is that in spite of objections to the contrary, the Old Testament doesn’t treat all of its laws the same way either. We often hear that “the Law” is a unit, that all of it is moral, and that if any of it is abrogated, then all of it must be. While the issues involved in this dispute among sincere brothers in Christ certainly require more than a simple blog post, I offer the following short critique of those views which teach that Old Testament law is monolithic and without any divisions.</span></p>
<h3>Old Testament</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>1. Old Testament laws are divided into categories</strong>. Deuteronomy 4:13-14 says, “And he declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, that is, the Ten Commandments, and he wrote them on two tablets of stone. And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and rules, that you might do them in the land you are going to possess.” Notice that the “Ten Commandments” (lit. ten words) are distinct from the other designations of Old Testament law: “statutes” and “rules.” Similarly, Moses writes, “Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the rules that the LORD your God commanded me to teach you” (Deut 6:1). These three kinds of laws: commandments, statutes, and rules, overlap in their semantic range, but they are not identical. Commandments (<em>mitsvah</em>) are “codes of law;” statutes (<em>hoq</em>) are “ordinances;” rules (<em>mishpat</em>) are “case laws.” Therefore, it’s far from correct to say the Old Testament does not divide its laws into various categories.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Furthermore, the order in which God gave the law in the book of Exodus implies the distinctivenesss of the Ten Commandments. God gave the Ten Commandments in Exodus 20. Then in Exodus 21-23, God reveals the civil laws. And then beginning in Exodus 25, God provides the ceremonial laws about the tabernacle. Thus, the Ten Commandments stand alone as distinct and primary, while all other laws in the Old Covenant are subsequent to them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>2. The Ten Commandments were revealed in a unique way</strong>. God gave the Ten Commandments on Mount Sinai with loud thunder, flashes of lightning, a thick cloud, and a “very loud trumpet blast” (Ex 19:16). No other laws were revealed this way. It was a striking and emotional experience for those who were there. God wanted it to be memorable. He intended the Ten Commandments to stand out in the minds of His people above all other laws. He wanted to impact their senses so that they would never forget the distinctive importance of these ten words. Furthermore, only the Ten Commandments were spoken by God to the whole congregation (Deut 4:12-13). The other commands were spoken through Moses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>3. God wrote the Ten Commandments with His own finger</strong>. Exodus 31:18 says God gave Moses “tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.” The other laws were written by the pen of Moses. The Ten Commandments were engraved on “stone” to communicate that they are fixed and permanent. God wrote the rest of the old covenant laws through Moses on paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>4. The Ten Commandments are uniquely sufficient among all Old Testament laws</strong>. The Old Testament tells us that the Ten Commandments were a sufficient summary of God’s most central laws. We see this taught in Deuteronomy 5:22, which says that after God had spoken the Ten Commandments, “he added no more.” After God gave the Ten Commandments, there was no need to add any more. The Ten Commandments sufficiently summarized the way God’s people were to express their love to Him and to one another. If God’s people obeyed these laws, then they would be keeping the heart of the law, and all other obedience would follow from it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>5. The Ten Commandments alone were placed in the Ark of the Covenant</strong>. God told Moses to put the Ten Commandments inside the ark of the covenant, but to “Take this Book of the Law and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant” (Deut 31:24-26). This shows how the Ten Commandments are at the heart of all the other Old Testament commandments. The civil and ceremonial laws were only to be kept in the land of Canaan (Deut 5:30-33), but the Ten Commandments were written on the hearts of OT believers, and were kept wherever the people went (Ps 37:31; 40:8; Is 51:7).</span></p>
<h3>New Testament</h3>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">The New Testament also makes distinctions among Old Testament laws. While it teaches that some Old Testament laws are abrogated, it shows that others are perpetually binding on the hearts and lives of believers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>1. Jesus teaches that the Ten Commandments are never to be abolished</strong>. He said, “For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not a dot will pass from the Law” (Matt 5:17). What law is Christ speaking about? He goes on to list laws from the Ten Commandments: do not murder (Matt 5:21-26); do not commit adultery (Matt 5:27-32); do not lie (Matt 5:33-37).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>2. Adam, the first Gentile, had the Ten Commandments written on his heart</strong>. Romans 2:14-15 says, “For when the Gentiles who do not have the law, <em>by nature</em>, do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law. They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness.” What law was Paul writing about? Just a few verses later, Paul goes on to list some of the Ten Commandments: do not steal (Rom 2:21), do not commit adultery (Rom 2:22), do not commit idolatry (Rom 2:22). This same law is written on the consciences of all who bear the image of God. Ephesians 4:24 explicitly links being made in God’s “likeness” to “righteousness,” which means “lawfulness.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">This shows us that there is a natural law within a man, summarized by the Ten Commandments. Other laws are coventantal or positive (posited) laws, which come from outside of a man. For example, Abraham knew by nature, from within, not to murder, but he did not know to be circumcised from within. God had to reveal the command to be circumcised by covenant from without in the Abrahamic covenant. Natural law, written on the human heart, cuts across all covenants. But covenantal positive laws change with the covenant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>3. Paul says one can “keep the law” without obeying the command to be circumcised</strong>. Many argue that the Old Testament law can’t be divided. But if that were true, then it would be impossible to keep the law without also keeping the command to be circumcised. Paul writes, “So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?” (Rom 2:26). Paul has a category for Gentiles who “keep the law” without obeying the Old Testament command to be circumcised. What law is Paul thinking about? Again, context shows, it’s the Ten Commandments (Rom 2:21-23).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>4. Paul distinguishes between “the law of commandments” and its “ordinances.”</strong>Ephesians 2:15 says that when Christ died, He abolished “the law of commandments <em>expressed</em> in ordinances.” Notice that Christ didn’t abolish the law of commandments itself, only its expression in ordinances. “Ordinances” are the national “rules” or “decrees” of Israel that were based on moral law, but not identical to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>5. In the new covenant, certain Old Testament “law” is written on our hearts</strong>. God blesses His new covenant people saying, “I will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts” (Heb 8:10).  That’s a quotation from Jeremiah 31, in which the author had Old Testament law in mind. Literally, the words “write them” mean “carve them,” calling to mind how God carved the Ten Commandments into tablets of stone. While the whole Old Covenant has been abrogated in Christ (Heb 8:13), the moral law of the Old Covenant, the Ten Commandments, are written on the hearts of believers (2 Cor 3:3). Old Testament ceremonial laws relating to priesthood are abolished: “When there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well,” but the moral law is written on the hearts of the members of the new covenant: “I will put my laws into their minds and write them on their hearts” (Heb 8:10).</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;">Therefore, it seems clear from both testaments that there is a division among Old Testament laws. The Ten Commandments are unique because they are a reflection of God’s own character. Paul teaches us that the Ten Commandments are written on the consciences of Gentiles. They were given by God in a unique way and stand above all other ordinances. In Christ’s death, He abolished the expression of the Ten Commandments in ordinances, but He did not abolish the Ten Commandments themselves. They are written on the hearts of all members of the new covenant, which was established in His blood.</span></span></p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: <strong>Gospel Texts on Sabbath-Keeping</strong></strong></p>
<p>A detailed examination of all the passages in the Gospels where Christ discusses the issue of the Sabbath will show that he never predicted its abolition, nor did he ever profane it. If fact, he could not profane it, nor advocate its profanation by others, without sinning. He was born under the law, not to profane it, but to keep it (Gal. 4:5). If Christ violated the Sabbath, then he sinned and would not be a suitable Savior for others. Instead, he advocated works of necessity (Matt. 12:1-8; Mk. 2:23-28; Lk. 6:1-5), mercy (Matt. 12:9-14; Mk. 3:1-6; Lk. 4:31-41; 6:6-11; 13:10-17; 14:1-6; Jn. 5:8-10; 7:23; 9:13-16), and piety (Matt. 12:9; Mk. 6:2; Lk. 4:16; 6:6; Jn. 7:22-23) on the Sabbath by his teaching and example. He never violated it, advocated its violation by others, or prophesied its soon demise. In fact, Mk. 2:27-28 prophesies the perpetuity of the Sabbath under his lordship as Son of Man.</p>
<p>Both Matt. 12:1-14 and Mk. 2:27-28 contain transcovenantal principles relating to the Sabbath. Works of mercy and necessity are lawful on the Sabbath, linking Jesus’ teaching with revelation given prior to his earthly ministry (i.e., the OT). Jesus as Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, linking the Sabbath and its Lord with future revelation (i.e., the NT). Jesus’ teaching on the Sabbath leaves us with the expectation that he will execute his lordship over the Sabbath in the future, during the inter-advental days of the new covenant. His teaching on the Sabbath is related to antecedent revelation (explicitly) and subsequent revelation (implicitly). It establishes a basis for its basic ethical perpetuity and yet in such a way as to expect changes in application due to the redemptive-historical shift that takes place due to his entrance into glory (i.e., resurrection/ascension).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/2011/05/wells-on-sabb-chapt-three-iv/">Tom Wells&#8217; book on the Sabbath: Chapter Three (IV)</a></p>
<p>Mark 2:23-28 narrates another incident between Jesus and his disciples and the Pharisees. Jesus was &#8220;passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain&#8221; (Mk. 2:23). The Pharisees said, &#8220;Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&#8221; (Mk. 2:24). This is the regulating question Jesus answers in this passage. According to the Pharisees&#8217; understanding, Christ&#8217;s disciples were violating the law of God by doing that which was, in their words, &#8220;not lawful on the Sabbath&#8221; (Mk. 2:24). Christ, as in Matt. 12:3-4, brings up the example of David and his companions entering the house of God and doing that &#8220;which [was] not lawful&#8230;&#8221; (Mk. 2:26). In Matt. 12:7, he pronounced his disciples innocent. In Matt. 12:12, Jesus said, &#8220;So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221; Though he does not pronounce his disciples innocent in Mark 2, he uses David and his companions as an example of someone in Scripture doing a similar thing his disciples were doing. It seems obvious that if his disciples were innocent in one text (Matt. 12), they are innocent in another (Mk. 2).[1] But how were they innocent? Did they, in fact, do that which was not lawful on the Sabbath? Obviously, Jesus did not think so in Matthew 12 or here. In Jesus&#8217; mind, they did that which was lawful. It was lawful because God desires compassion or mercy over sacrifice (cf. Matt. 12:7). In other words, Jesus makes a distinction between aspects of the Old Testament&#8217;s laws. Mercy overrules the positive aspects of the Sabbath under the old covenant.[2]</p>
<p>In Mk. 2:27, Jesus does as Paul and Moses do elsewhere. He draws a principle from creation that is germane to mankind (cf. Exod. 20:8-11 and 1 Tim. 2:12-13). Mark 2:27-28 says, &#8220;And He said to them, &#8216;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.&#8217;&#8221; <em>First</em>, note that both man and Sabbath are said to be made. The verb used by Mark in v. 27, evge,neto (&#8220;made&#8221;), comes from gi,nomai, which means &#8216;to become&#8217; or &#8216;to be.&#8217; It is the same verb used in Jn. 1:3, where it is translated &#8220;made.&#8221; There it refers to the creation of all things through the Word. What Jesus is saying in Mk. 2:27 is that, in the past, both man and the Sabbath came into being (i.e., &#8216;were made&#8217;) and that coming into being is described by one verb. This leads us to the conclusion that man and Sabbath were made at the same time. It would be quite clumsy to separate the making of man and the making of the Sabbath by hundreds and maybe even thousands of years by placing the Sabbath&#8217;s birth after Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egypt in Exod. 16 or 20. Since we know that man was created (i.e., &#8216;came into being&#8217;) according to Gen. 1 and 2 in the Garden of Eden, Christ would have us to conclude that the Sabbath, as he refers to it here, was made at the same time and in the same place (cf. Exod. 20:11). This relates Christ&#8217;s teaching on the Sabbath with previous revelation.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, both Sabbath and man are singular and articular in the Greek text (To. sa,bbaton&#8230; to.n a;nqrwpon [&#8220;the Sabbath&#8230;the man&#8221;]). Both words occur twice in this verse and both words are preceded by an article each time. This is one way to emphasize both Sabbath and man. Jesus did not say &#8220;The Sabbath was made for the Jews&#8221; or &#8220;the Sabbaths[3] were made for the Jews.&#8221; He said &#8220;the Sabbath&#8221; was made for &#8220;the man.&#8221; &#8220;The man&#8221; refers either to Adam as the head of the human race or mankind. Either way, it is clear that Christ goes back to the creation account and sees both man and the Sabbath being made. In context, Christ not only corrects the Pharisees for misunderstanding the Sabbath (Mk. 2:23-24), he, in effect, rebukes their narrow-minded and unbiblical approach to this issue. Jesus teaches us that the Sabbath is not unique to the Jews. God caused it to come into being as he caused Adam and all mankind to come into being for his glory and their good. The Sabbath is as old as man, according to Christ, not merely as old as the Jews. Again, this relates Christ&#8217;s teaching with previous revelation.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, the Sabbath is said to have been &#8220;made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.&#8221; Two observations are worthy to consider. <em>First</em>, &#8220;[t]he Sabbath was made <em>for</em> man.&#8221; It was not made for God. God does not need a Sabbath. We do. It was made by God for our good. <em>Second</em>, man was not made &#8220;for the Sabbath.&#8221; Man existed first. His needs existed before the Sabbath did. The Sabbath came into being to serve man&#8217;s needs to be like God and to enjoy him. We don&#8217;t serve the Sabbath, it serves us so we can serve God better. Again, this relates Christ&#8217;s teaching with previous revelation.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, Christ puts his stamp of Messianic lordship on the Sabbath that was made at creation. &#8220;Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (Mk. 2:28). This provides us with the expectation that the Sabbath will abide under his lordship and will take on characteristics appropriate to this lordship under the new covenant (cf. Rev. 1:10). John Murray comments:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>What the Lord is affirming is that the Sabbath has its place within the sphere of his messianic lordship and that he exercises lordship over the Sabbath because the Sabbath was made for man. Since he is Lord of the Sabbath it is his to guard it against those distortions and perversions with which Pharisaism had surrounded it and by which its truly beneficent purpose has been defeated. But he is also its Lord to guard and vindicate its permanent place within that messianic lordship which he exercises over all things&#8211;he is Lord of the Sabbath, too. And he is Lord of it, not for the purpose of depriving men of that inestimable benefit which the Sabbath bestows, but for the purpose of bringing to the fullest realization on behalf of men that beneficent design for which the Sabbath was instituted. If the Sabbath was made for man, and if Jesus is the Son of man to save man, surely the lordship which he exercises to that end is not to deprive man of that which was made for his good, but to seal to man that which the Sabbath institution involves. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath&#8211;we dare not tamper with his authority and we dare not misconstrue the intent of his words.[4]</p>
<p>It is clear from the text in Daniel, where the phrase &#8220;Son of Man&#8221; comes from, that it refers to Christ in the posture of enthronement, immediately following his ascension into glory and is a title appropriate for him during the days in which he is given a kingdom and the nations become his.</p>
<p>I was watching in the night visions, And behold, <em>One </em>like the Son of Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near before Him. Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion <em>is </em>an everlasting dominion, Which shall not pass away, And His kingdom <em>the one </em>Which shall not be destroyed. (Dan. 7:13-14)</p>
<p>In other words, Christ administrates the Sabbath as the Son of Man during the whole interadvental period&#8211;the days of the new covenant. This relates Chris&#8217;s teaching on the Sabbath with both previous and future revelation. Christ&#8217;s lordship over the Sabbath also implies Christ&#8217;s deity. The Sabbath is God&#8217;s (Isa. 56:4; 58:13). Since Christ is Lord of the Sabbath as Son of Man and since this title is his during the inter-advental days of the new covenant, then we should not be shocked if the Sabbath bears unique characteristics of his lordship under the new covenant. Patrick Fairbairn says:</p>
<p>He is Lord of the Sabbath, and, as such, has a right to order everything concerning it, so as to make it, in the fullest sense, a day of blessing for man&#8211;a right, therefore, if He should see fit, to transfer its observance from the last day of the week to the first, that it might be associated with the consummation of His redemptive work, and to make it, in accordance with the impulsive life and energy thereby brought in, more than in the past, a day of active and hallowed employment for the good of men.[5]</p>
<p>Jesus (Matt. 19:4-5 [and Mk. 2:27-28]), Paul (1 Tim. 2:12-13), and Moses (Exod. 20:11) argue in similar fashion. Each of them goes back to the creation account for the basis of ethics in terms of marriage, divorce, male/female roles in the church, and Sabbath. They all apply the same reasoning, though to different issues. If the basis for their argument is creation, and if creation transcends covenants and cultures, how can we not conclude that what they are arguing for applies to all men at all times, though dependant upon revelation from God in terms of specific application at any given point in redemptive history? In other words, though the application may vary due to various redemptive-historical situations (i.e., divorce permitted due to the entrance of sin, 7<sup>th</sup> day Sabbath to 1<sup>st</sup> day Sabbath/Lord&#8217;s Day, etc.), the principle itself stands. And the reason why it stands is due to the order and ethical implications of creation drawn out by the Bible itself.</p>
<p>If the principle applies to marriage, divorce, and male/female roles in the church, then doesn&#8217;t it still apply to the Sabbath as well? If it does not apply to the Sabbath, upon what grounds is the principle dismissed? If one says, &#8220;The Sabbath was an ordinance for the Jews only. It was theirs&#8217; as God&#8217;s old covenant people to apply to their culture alone in the Promised Land,&#8221; then couldn&#8217;t someone argue the same for male/female roles in the church? They could say, &#8220;Paul was dealing with a culture-relative issue. His reasoning applied to that culture alone. Women, therefore, may have authority over men in the church and may teach and preach to them. Women may be pastors.&#8221; Some in our day argue this way. But when the Bible bases ethics upon creation, the principle applies to all cultures at all times. And until this age gives way to the fullness of the age to come, creation-based ethics (i.e., creation ordinances) are moral laws for all men.</p>
<hr size="1">[1] If Matthew utilized Mark, it could be that he filled out the incident for his own purposes. If Mark used Matthew, it could be that he trimmed the incident because he knew Matthew had dealt with it in detail. If the Gospel writers wrote independent of each other based on eye-witness accounts, each one wrote what they did for authorial purposes. Either way, both texts were inspired by God and can and ought to be used to interpret each other.</p>
<p>[2] See the <em>Second London Baptist Confession</em>, 22:7, where it acknowledges that the Sabbath is &#8220;a positive moral, and perpetual commandment&#8230;&#8221; I take this to mean that the Sabbath can and does take upon itself temporary aspects (i.e., positive laws) during the history of redemption, which can and do change, yet its essence is moral or perpetual. This means that its positive aspects may give way to the moral or perpetual aspects of God&#8217;s law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/2011/05/wells-on-the-sabbath-chap-three-iii/">Tom Wells&#8217; book on the Sabbath: Chapter Three (III)</a></p>
<p><strong>Mark 2:27-28</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Wells discusses Mk. 2:27-28 (48-57). He claims, and rightly so, &#8220;There is no command in these verses&#8230;&#8221; (49). He continues, &#8220;&#8230;but an argument for Sabbath keeping has been drawn from each of them&#8221; (49). He states the argument this way:</p>
<p>The argument is twofold. First, if God at creation made the Sabbath a blessing for mankind, He certainly did not do so only to abolish it later. Second, when the Lord Jesus announces Himself as Lord of the Sabbath, it seems unlikely to suppose that He intended to exercise His Lordship over it by doing away with it. (49)</p>
<p>Dealing with this twofold argument, Wells assumes &#8220;that God commanded man to keep the Sabbath at the time of creation&#8221; (49), though he does not believe that to be the case. Discussing the first argument, he says:</p>
<p>The first argument implies the impossibility of God later abolishing anything that He made for mankind&#8217;s benefit at the creation. But is this sound reasoning? It may be true or it may be false, but it is certainly not obvious. Where is it written that if God once made something a blessing for mankind at large that He would never suspend it? (49)</p>
<p>He then gives examples of many things God has made for man&#8217;s benefit that he subsequently takes from man (i.e., the Garden of Eden, many wonderful fruits, extinct birds and animals, the benefits of family life for some believers in Christ, etc. [49-50]). What shall we say to this?</p>
<p>Wells asserts, without citing anyone, that &#8220;The first argument implies the impossibility of God later abolishing <em>anything</em> that He made for mankind&#8217;s benefit at the creation&#8221; (49; emphasis mine). Does the first argument imply this? Is this the way those Wells is arguing against state their position? I think the answer to both questions is a resounding, &#8220;No!&#8221; Do those who believe that God instituted some things for mankind&#8217;s good at creation also believe in &#8220;the impossibility of God later abolishing&#8221; those things? Again, Wells cites no one. In fact, he over-states his case. Claiming that God instituted some things for man&#8217;s good at creation does not <em>necessarily</em> imply the impossibility of God later abolishing those things. The Garden of Eden is a case in point, as Wells says.</p>
<p>The argument Wells set up (i.e., that &#8220;God at creation made the Sabbath a blessing for mankind&#8221;) needs additional elements to necessarily imply what he claims. Those who argue this would need to state that it is <em>impossible</em> for God to institute <em>anything</em> for man&#8217;s benefit at creation and then abolish it later. I don&#8217;t know of anyone who would argue this way, though someone who does may exist.</p>
<p>But there is another problem with Wells&#8217; response. The examples he uses of things instituted by God at creation for the benefit of man and later abolished are not identified as creation ordinances by those he is combating. Creation ordinances are not co-extensive with everything instituted by God for man in the Garden of Eden. Wells himself identifies what those who hold to creation ordinances identify as such. He says, &#8220;Often three are cited: marriage, labor and Sabbath&#8221; (26). In other words, for example, the Garden of Eden is not a creation ordinance in the minds of Wells&#8217; opponents. Even though it appears that Wells does not adhere to the doctrine of creation ordinances, he is disagreeing with those who do and should have seen the problem with arguing the way he did. In effect, he put words in the mouths of those he is critiquing and then shows those words to be impossible to square with Scripture. I found Wells&#8217; argument unconvincing and his method of argumentation, at this point, very sloppy.[1]</p>
<p>After extensive discussion, Wells denies that this verse teaches any sort of Sabbath perpetuity under the lordship of Christ as Son of Man. However, is it that simple? Let&#8217;s consider these verses in context in our next post.</p>
<p>[1] I am sure I have been guilty of the same thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As far as Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the Sabbath, I would say this…If the Sabbath as instituted at creation was a symbol and type of the eternal state, then the Sabbath between creation and consummation is at least that. The Sabbath is not a symbol or type of Christ, strictly speaking; it is a symbol and type of that which Christ attains for us – the eschatological state. And until that state comes in its fullness and finality, the Sabbath yet remains as its symbol and type. I think Hebrews 4 argues this.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/2011/05/wells-sabbath-chapter-three-ii/">Tom Wells&#8217; book on the Sabbath: Chapter Three (II)</a></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 12:1-14&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wells references Matt. 12:1-14 several times in chapter 3[1] but offers no exposition of the passage.[2] I will offer a brief exposition.</p>
<p>In Matt. 12, we are told that &#8220;Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat&#8221; (Matt. 12:1). The Pharisees replied, &#8220;Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!&#8221; (Matt. 12:2). Jesus then offers two examples from the OT; &#8220;&#8230;David&#8230; and those who were with him&#8221; (Matt. 12:3) and &#8220;the priests in the temple&#8221; (Matt. 12:5).[3] Concerning the priests, he says, &#8220;Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?&#8221; (Matt. 12:5). Whatever the priests were doing, the Pharisees&#8217; logic implied it was a violation of the Sabbath. Their logic taught that the priests, David, and Christ&#8217;s disciples were profaning the Sabbath. But Jesus says the priests &#8220;&#8230;are blameless&#8221; (Matt. 12:5). Then he quotes Hos. 6:6. He says, &#8220;But if you had known what this means, &#8216;<em>I desire mercy and not sacrifice</em>,&#8217; you would not have condemned the guiltless&#8221; (Matt. 12:7).[4] He pronounces his disciples &#8220;guiltless&#8221; by referencing two OT examples. In the next section of Matt. 12, the Pharisees ask, &#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221; (Matt. 12:10). Jesus concludes in v. 12, &#8220;Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221; This clearly teaches that healing on the Sabbath was lawful as was preserving the life of a sheep (vv. 10-12). His disciples ate because eating is necessary to sustain human life. All of these actions, according to Christ, were lawful on the Sabbath according to OT law. Jesus was correcting faulty thinking about the Sabbath by consulting prior revelation.</p>
<p>Someone might want to offer Matt. 12 as an example of Jesus abrogating the Sabbath (cf. Mk. 2:23-28 and Lk. 6:1-11).[5] They might claim that Jesus advocates Sabbath-breaking thereby proving that he was abolishing it. But does this text bear this out? Did Jesus, in fact, advocate Sabbath-breaking during his earthly ministry? We have just examined Matt. 12:1-14 and seen Christ justifying works of necessity and mercy and concluding in v. 12, &#8220;Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221; The &#8220;good&#8221; in the context of Matt. 12 involved not only what his disciples did and what he did, but what David and those with him and the old covenant priests did. The supposed violation of the Sabbath in this passage (and others) is actually an upholding of the Sabbath and in accordance with OT revelation. Jesus never advocated Sabbath-breaking during his earthly ministry. Jesus&#8217; teaching upholds existing Sabbath law.</p>
<p>Those who offer this objection may claim that when Jesus says, &#8220;But I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple&#8221; (v. 6) and &#8220;For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (v. 8), Jesus is claiming authority to abolish the Sabbath as he abolished the temple. In once sense, Christ did abolish the Sabbath. He abolished it in its various functions under the old covenant. And, in one sense, Christ abolished the temple. He did not, however, abolish the temple in all senses. His church is now God&#8217;s temple, where spiritual sacrifices are offered (Eph. 2:19-22; 1 Pt. 2:4-5). What does Jesus mean, when he says, &#8220;But I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple&#8221; (Mt. 12:6) and &#8220;For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (Matt. 12:8; cf. Mk. 2:28)? Fairbairn offers this explanation:</p>
<p>The Temple, He had said, has claims of service, which it was no proper desecration of the Sabbath, but the reverse, to satisfy; and &#8216;a greater than the Temple was there.&#8217; &#8216;The Temple yields to Christ, the Sabbath yields to the Temple, therefore the Sabbath yields to Christ&#8217;&#8211;so the sentiment is syllogistically expressed by Bengel; but yields, it must be observed, in both cases alike, only for the performance of works not antagonistic, but homogeneous, to its nature. &#8230; He is Lord of the Sabbath, and, as such, has a right to order everything concerning it, so as to make it, in the fullest sense, a day of blessing for man&#8211;a right, therefore, if He should see fit, to transfer its observance from the last day of the week to the first, that it might be associated with the consummation of His redemptive work, and to make it, in accordance with the impulsive life and energy thereby brought in, more than in the past, a day of active and hallowed employment for the good of men.[6]</p>
<p>Just as the temple yields to Christ and is transformed to fit the redemptive-historical circumstances brought in by his death and resurrection/exaltation, so the Sabbath yields to Christ and is transformed to fit the redemptive-historical circumstances brought in by his death and resurrection/exaltation. The new covenant has both a temple and a Sabbath. This connects Christ&#8217;s teaching on the temple and the Sabbath with subsequent revelation.</p>
<p>Instead of Matt. 12 proving that Christ abolished the Sabbath, it actually argues that he upheld it and sought to correct the Pharisees&#8217; faulty interpretation of Sabbath law. Fairbairn says, &#8220;Jesus grasped, as usual, the real spirit of the institution; for we are to remember, He is explaining the law of the Sabbath as it then stood, not superseding it by another.&#8221;[7] Christ upheld the Sabbath, cleared it of Pharisaic encumbrances, and set the stage for further revelation about it.</p>
<p>This objection assumes that the Sabbath in all senses was temporary, ceremonial law. Ceremonial laws are temporary laws for old covenant Israel and were a shadow of things to come (Col. 2:16-17). They were all abrogated by the coming of Christ and the inauguration of the new covenant (2 Cor. 3:7-18; Gal. 3-4; Eph. 2:14-16; Col. 2:16; and Heb. 8-10 [cf. esp. 8:6-7, 13; 9:9-10, 15; 10:1, 9, 15-18]). If the Sabbath is ceremonial law in all senses, then it has been abrogated. But the Sabbath is not ceremonial law in all senses, as we have seen (cf. Gen. 2:2-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Is. 56:2, 4, 6; and Mk. 2:27). And if Jesus considered it as ceremonial only, one would think he would treat it like he did other ceremonial laws. Beckwith and Stott comment:</p>
<p>But if Jesus regarded the sabbath as purely ceremonial and purely temporary, it is remarkable that he gives so much attention to it in his teaching, and also that in all he teaches about it he never mentions its temporary character. This is even more remarkable when one remembers that he emphasizes the temporary character of other parts of the Old Testament ceremonial&#8211;the laws of purity in Mark 7:14-23 and Luke 11:39-41, and the temple (with its sacrifices) in Mark 13:2 and John 4:21. By contrast, &#8230;he seems&#8230;to speak of the sabbath as one of the unchanging ordinances for all mankind.[8]</p>
<p>Jesus neither abrogated the Sabbath in all senses in his earthly ministry nor did he predict its soon demise. He upheld it and gave evidence that it would continue under his lordship as the Son of Man (Mk. 2:27-28).</p>
<p>We will look at Mk. 2:27-28 in our next post.</p>
<hr size="1">[1] I counted 10.</p>
<p>[2] In fact, the book contains little exegesis. Wells cites many texts and makes many observations; but he does little exegesis or exposition of passages. There was much proof-texting surrounded by observations that put the reader in an interpretive strait-jacket. I found his theological-interpretive method not very sound.</p>
<p>[3] Notice that Jesus is referring to previous revelation.</p>
<p>[4] Here is another reference to previous revelation.</p>
