										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">A wonderful defense of the importance of creeds and confessions has stood at the opening of A Modern Exposition since its first publication in 1989 (the 300th anniversary of its first adoption in London in 1689). I did not write that defense. It was written by Dr. Robert Paul Martin who went to be with the Lord a few months ago in 2016.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have always wondered if &#8220;Dr. Bob&#8221; received sufficient credit for this fine essay. In my preface to the Fifth Edition of A Modern Exposition I attempt to make sure he does. Here is what I say:</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Finally, let me dedicate to Dr. Robert Paul Martin and his family this 5th Edition of A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession. His Introduction on the Legitimacy and Use of Confessions has stood at the beginning of A Modern Exposition in each of its editions including the present one. He has in my view never received the credit he deserves for that outstanding little essay. &#8220;Dr. Bob&#8221; passed away a few months ago in 2016, but his godliness and labors for Christ&#8217;s Kingdom are not forgotten.&#8221;</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><em>From the new preface to the 5th Edition of </em>A Modern Exposition:</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<p style="text-align: center;">
</blockquote>
<p style="text-align: justify;">&#8220;Let me say something about the reason and necessity for this 5th Edition. In the 2nd and 3rd Editions of <em>A Modern Exposition</em> a number of important improvements to the first edition were made. Somehow in the 4th Edition published in 2009 these improvements were forgotten and the manuscript reverted to its original (1st Edition) form with all of its inaccuracies. I only discovered the extent of the problem in the last year. Graham Hind of Evangelical Press immediately responded to the problem by withdrawing the remaining unsold copies of the 4th Edition from circulation for sale. They also agreed to publish this 5th Edition as soon as I could prepare it for publication.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">In this 5th Edition of A Modern Exposition the improvements found in the 2nd and 3rd Editions are restored. I have made further (what I think to be) improvements by revising two appendices found in previous editions and adding two more. The reader (in my opinion) will be greatly helped if he turns to the back of the book and reads these appendices first.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: justify;">The Manuscript for the 5th edition of <em>A Modern Exposition of the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith</em> has been sent to the publisher! &nbsp;Over the next few weeks we plan to share some insights, additions and improvements that you can expect to see in the new edition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
<p style="text-align: justify;">I want to enlarge on the improvements in the 5th edition of <em>A Modern Exposition</em>.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">One of the major improvements, I hope, is in the expanded appendices at the end of the exposition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appendix A</strong>: The Historical Origin of the 1689 &#8230; corrects some historical inaccuracies owing to the primitive state of the sources I used to construct it in the original version of the Exposition.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appendix B:</strong> The Analytical Outline of the 1689 &#8230; is a development of an outline I originally borrowed from Greg Nichols. It is now refined by the insights I have gleaned from Jim Renihan&#8217;s teaching on the structure of the Confession.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appendix C</strong>: The Doctrinal Overview of the 1689 Baptist Confession is entirely new. It provides an argument that the Confession embodies a tradition which combines historic (catholic) orthodoxy with Reformed theology and Baptist principles.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Appendix D</strong>: The Proper Holding of the 1689 Baptist Confession is my response to the notion that the membership in a confessional church requires full subscription and that, therefore, the 1689 is too detailed to be a good, local church confession. I argue that elders must teach the Confession and thus fully subscribe, but members need only sweetly submit to the Confession and need not fully subscribe. This article has been posted on <a href="http://founders.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Founders.org</a> &nbsp;for some years now. <a href="http://founders.org/fj61/how-and-why-your-church-should-hold-to-the-1689-confession/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">How (and Why) Your Church Should Hold to the 1689 Confession</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hamilton says, &#8220;Against Sailhamer&#8217;s suggestion that &#8220;the narratives of Genesis 12-50 show little relation to Genesis 1-11,&#8221; [Hamilt0n is referencing Sailhamer&#8217;s <em>The Meaning of the Pentateuch</em>, 301] I will argue here that the narratives of Genesis 12-50 are thick with the blessings of Genesis 12 overcoming the curses of Genesis 3&#8243; (Hamilton, <em>God&#8217;s Glory in Salvation through Judgment</em> [GG], 80). I noticed that Hamilton takes Sailhamer to task again several pages later. Sailhamer&#8217;s book was pushed hard by John Piper when it came out. I remember watching a video clip on it (or maybe it was an email I read) and Dr. Piper was really recommending the book. I have not read Sailhamer&#8217;s book but do recommend this (<a href="http://jimhamilton.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/sbjt-v14-n-2-hamilton.pdf">http://jimhamilton.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/sbjt-v14-n-2-hamilton.pdf</a>) by Dr. Hamilton. I agree with Dr. Hamilton that &#8220;the narratives of 12-50 are thick with the blessings of Genesis 12 overcoming the curses of Genesis 3.&#8221; He does a wonderful job illustrating that in chapter two and his utilization of Genesis 3:15-19 is masterful. Bravo, Dr. H.!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&#8220;A masterful examination of the Puritan&#8217;s positive attitude toward missions and evangelism, showing their passionate desire to seek the salvation of the lost. Through the writings of five notable Puritans: Richard Sibbes, Richard Baxter, John Eliot, Cotton Mather and Jonathan Edwards, Rooy explores Puritan missiology in its theological foundation, its development and establishment, and its progress. Individuals and churches alike will be inspired by this historical and theological survey of magisterial Puritans.&#8221; &#8211; Joel Beeke</p>
<p>&#8220;Of excellent quality throughout, this volume traces out the theology that leads to the evangelization of the world: divine sovereignty and human responsibility, conversion, and the role of the church in missions. The biographical sketches enhance the volume. This is all rich material. Highlights for me are the practical section on evangelism from Richard Baxter&#8217;s &#8216;A Christian Directory&#8217; and the preceptive analysis of Jonathan Edwards&#8217; book &#8216;A History of Redemption,&#8217; which the author suggests is perhaps Edwards&#8217; best claim to originality in theology. I commend this volume highly.&#8221; &#8211; Erroll Hulse</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Below is a portion of chapter one of Gary Crampton&#8217;s new book, From Paedobaptism to Credobaptism. You can purchase the book for $14.30 at <a href="http://www.rbap.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBAP</a>.</p>
<p>A Problem with the Doctrine of Infant Baptism in the Westminster Standards</p>
<p>The present writer is in agreement with B. B. Warfield that the Westminster Standards, consisting of the Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, &#8220;are the richest and most precise and best guarded statement ever penned of all that enters into evangelical religion, and of all that must be safeguarded if evangelical religion is to persist in the world.&#8221;[1] Then too, Richard Baxter was correct, when he stated, &#8220;As far as I am able to judge, the Christian world, since the days of the apostles, had never a synod more excellent than this [the Westminster Assembly].&#8221;[2]</p>
<p>As a minister of the gospel, I believe that the Westminster Standards provide the finest summary of the system of doctrine taught in Holy Scripture.[3] In this sense, the Standards are considered to be a subordinate standard to the inspired, infallible, inerrant Word of God. The Bible alone has a systematic monopoly on truth.</p>
<p>The Standards, as with all confessions and creeds, must be evaluated in light of Scripture. One must adhere to the Berean principle of Acts 17:11, where we are enjoined to &#8220;search the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things be true.&#8221; As stated in the Westminster Confession (31:4) and as valuable as confessions and creeds are (and they are very valuable), the fact is that &#8220;all synods or councils, since the apostles&#8217; times, whether general or particular, may err; and many have erred.&#8221; Therefore, says the Confession (1:10), &#8220;The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.&#8221; As taught in the Larger Catechism (Q. 3), &#8220;The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the Word of God, the only rule of faith and obedience.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is while engaged in a thorough study of the two New Testament sacraments, baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper, that I encountered a problem with the doctrine of infant baptism. The problem is three-fold: first, there are no examples of infant baptism in the Bible; second, baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper go together; and third, there are multiple differences among paedobaptists as to why infants should be baptized.</p>
<p>[1] Benjamin B. Warfield, Selected Shorter Writings, edited by John E. Meeter (Phillipsburg, NJ: Presbyterian and Reformed, 1973), II:660.</p>
<p>[2] Cited on the back cover of Westminster Confession of Faith (Glasgow: Free Presbyterian Publications, 1994). All citations from the Westminster Standards, comprised of the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, are from this publication. The English has been modernized. Note is made that when this author says that he is in agreement with what Warfield and Baxter have said about the Westminster Standards, the same could be said (with certain nuances here and there) about the Congregational Savoy Declaration (1658) and the London Baptist Confession of 1689, because some 90% of the doctrines taught by these three confessions are in agreement with one another. See Errol Hulse, The Testimony of Baptism (Sussex: Carey Publications, 1982), 57.</p>
<p>[3] Again, a similar statement could be made (with certain nuances) with regard to the Savoy Declaration and the London Baptist Confession of 1689.</p>
