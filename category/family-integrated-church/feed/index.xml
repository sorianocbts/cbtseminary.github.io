										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may have already heard or seen that I will be speaking at&nbsp;<em><a title="Worship of God Conference" href="https://ncfic.org/events/view/the-worship-of-god" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Worship of God Conference</a>&nbsp;</em>of the National Center for Family-Integrated Churches. This conference will be held&nbsp;October 31-November 2, 2013&nbsp;at the Ridgecrest Conference Center near Asheville, NC. &nbsp;I am excited to take the two slots that Scott Brown has asked me to fill. &nbsp;The subjects are ones that I care passionately about. &nbsp;I will be speaking once on the subject of&nbsp;<em>The Worship of God in the Great Confessions of the Church</em>&nbsp;and once on the important question&nbsp;<em>Is There a Regulative Principle? &nbsp;</em>In this session I will show that, while all of life is addressed by the sufficient Scriptures, the sufficiency of Scripture has a special and detailed relevance and application to the church and its worship that is different than its application to the rest of life. This special application of the Scriptures to the church and its worship is historically known as the regulative principle of worship.</p>
<p>My concerns about the Family-Integrated Church movement are no secret. And I have not ceased to be concerned about the theological and practical issues I have raised. &nbsp;Over the past few years, however, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover that men like Scott Brown, Jeff Pollard, and Voddie Baucham are heartily confessional and truly and firmly convinced of the system of doctrine (including the ecclesiology) taught in the 1689 Baptist Confession. &nbsp;Whatever contradictions of the Confession some who identify themselves with FIC movement may believe and practice, these men love the 1689 Baptist Confession. Particularly encouraging to me are their clear and correct views of the Christian Sabbath and the Regulative Principle.</p>
<p>This is why we will be featuring a series of videos created by the NCFIC on&nbsp;<em>The Worship of God</em>&nbsp;on our website for the next few weeks. &nbsp;You will here men like Joel Beeke, Paul Washer, Conrad Mbewe, and others sharing convictions and perspectives about the worship of God to which I can give a loud&nbsp;<em>Amen!&nbsp;</em>and which I can only pray will increasingly spread through the global church of God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some of you may have already heard or seen that I will be speaking at&nbsp;<em><a title="Worship of God Conference" href="https://ncfic.org/events/view/the-worship-of-god" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Worship of God Conference</a>&nbsp;</em>of the National Center for Family-Integrated Churches. This conference will be held&nbsp;October 31-November 2, 2013&nbsp;at the Ridgecrest Conference Center near Asheville, NC. &nbsp;I am excited to take the two slots that Scott Brown has asked me to fill. &nbsp;The subjects are ones that I care passionately about. &nbsp;I will be speaking once on the subject of&nbsp;<em>The Worship of God in the Great Confessions of the Church</em>&nbsp;and once on the important question&nbsp;<em>Is There a Regulative Principle? &nbsp;</em>In this session I will show that, while all of life is addressed by the sufficient Scriptures, the sufficiency of Scripture has a special and detailed relevance and application to the church and its worship that is different than its application to the rest of life. This special application of the Scriptures to the church and its worship is historically known as the regulative principle of worship.</p>
<p>My concerns about the Family-Integrated Church movement are no secret. And I have not ceased to be concerned about the theological and practical issues I have raised. &nbsp;Over the past few years, however, I have been pleasantly surprised to discover that men like Scott Brown, Jeff Pollard, and Voddie Baucham are heartily confessional and truly and firmly convinced of the system of doctrine (including the ecclesiology) taught in the 1689 Baptist Confession. &nbsp;Whatever contradictions of the Confession some who identify themselves with FIC movement may believe and practice, these men love the 1689 Baptist Confession. Particularly encouraging to me are their clear and correct views of the Christian Sabbath and the Regulative Principle.</p>
<p>This is why we will be featuring a series of videos created by the NCFIC on&nbsp;<em>The Worship of God</em>&nbsp;on our website for the next few weeks. &nbsp;You will here men like Joel Beeke, Paul Washer, Conrad Mbewe, and others sharing convictions and perspectives about the worship of God to which I can give a loud&nbsp;<em>Amen!&nbsp;</em>and which I can only pray will increasingly spread through the global church of God.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is, I think, the last of my blogs on the subject of the Family-Integrated Church movement.  I have attempted to commend the movement where I could.  I have also tried to present my critiques of it (where they were necessary) in an irenic fashion.  I hope I have succeeded.  I have also tried to distinguish the several streams which make up this complex movement and not paint with too broad a brush.</p>
<p>I want to conclude by stating my genuine respect particularly for those men in this movement who hold (as I believe) my own 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith.  Scott Brown and Voddie Baucham seem to me (judging from their books) to be men with whom on most subjects I have deep, precious, and all too rare agreement.  In my view we should find ways to express that agreement—even if we cannot agree on exactly the same philosophy of ministry for the church.</p>
<p>There are obstacles to the unity for which I am pleading in this blog.  Too many Reformed Baptist churches have been disappointed and injured by their experiences with those who claim to represent the Family-Integrated Church movement.  Such folks sometimes have done things in the name of it that, I believe, would make Scott and Voddie shudder.  On the other hand, it is possible that some who represent the Family-Integrated Church movement have not been received by Reformed Baptist churches with the grace, patience, and redemptive love we owe to all Christians.  James 3:2 remarks:  “For we all stumble in many ways. If anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body as well.” Psalm 139:23-24 adds: “Search me, O God, and know my heart; Try me and know my anxious thoughts;  And see if there be any hurtful way in me, And lead me in the everlasting way.”</p>
<p>In my view we should not divide over a difference of this kind in the philosophy of ministry we adopt as local churches.  It may be that different views cannot be combined in the same church and in the same eldership.  But this does not mean that two churches which differ on their philosophy of ministry, but revere the same Confession of Faith, cannot hold fellowship as churches.  For myself, I grant liberty to such Family-Integrated Church folks to practice their views in their churches.  I may think their views unnecessary, imprudent, and unwise, but I do not think them sinful.  I only wish that they would grant Reformed Baptist churches the same liberty.  It seems to me that given what they believe they should be able to do this.  It seems to me that objectively speaking we are not that far apart and that there is very much more which unites us than divides us.</p>
<p>Ephesians 6:23-24 states my last thought:  “Peace be to the brethren, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  Grace be with all those who love our Lord Jesus Christ with incorruptible love.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Samuel, Jesus, and Paul are sometimes brought forward in response to the family-integrated rejection of age-segregated Sunday Schools and youth meetings.  Are the descriptions of what happened in the case of these children normative for us?  Let us remind ourselves of what actually happened in each case.</p>
<p>Samuel was taken to Eli to be raised and instructed by Eli when very young (1 Samuel 1-2).  1 Samuel 1:24-25  records:  &#8220;Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with a three-year-old bull and one ephah of flour and a jug of wine, and brought him to the house of the LORD in Shiloh, although the child was young.  Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the boy to Eli.&#8221; 1 Samuel 2:11 adds: &#8220;Then Elkanah went to his home at Ramah. But the boy ministered to the LORD before Eli the priest.&#8221;</p>
<p>Jesus was instructed by the priests in the temple when accidentally left in Jerusalem by his parents (Luke 2). Luke 2:46-47 records:  &#8220;Then, after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them and asking them questions.  And all who heard Him were amazed at His understanding and His answers.&#8221;</p>
<p>Paul was apparently sent to learn from Gamaliel when a very young man.  Acts 22:3 says: &#8220;I am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated under Gamaliel&#8230;&#8221;  The word, educated, in this verse is usually translated <em>brought up</em> and everywhere else in the NT and LXX is used of the bringing up of children.  It, thus, suggests&#8212;along with the very wording of the verse&#8212;that young Saul was sent to be educated by Gamaliel as a child.</p>
<p>A number of observations on these examples tend to suggest that should have some normative significance for the subject of the religious education of children.</p>
<p>First, though the story of Samuel does come from the out-of-kilter era of the Judges, yet it is not found in the Book of Judges and not governed by its theme. Judges 21:25 states that theme: &#8220;In those days there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes.&#8221;  Rather, it is presented as the beginning of a new era of blessing in the life of Israel marked by the raising up of the first, theocratic prophet, Samuel.  Samuel&#8217;s devotion and service to Eli throughout the relevant passage seems to be commended.  Furthermore, God blesses Hannah&#8217;s dedicating of Samuel to serving Eli in the holy place by giving her five more children.  To put it differently, Hannah is presented very positively by the narrator both as to the nature of her piety and the results of it.  Part and parcel of this piety was her dedication of Samuel to the Lord&#8217;s service and to being reared by Eli.</p>
<p>Second, <em>A Weed in the Church</em> actually seems to some degree to acknowledge that the example of Samuel is not merely descriptive.  Scott Brown says this example may be &#8220;legitimately&#8221; brought up and calls it an &#8220;exception&#8221; which is not to be thought of as the &#8220;norm&#8221; for child-rearing.  (65)  Still, if I hear aright what Scott is saying in his paragraph on Samuel, it seems to me that he draws back from saying that what Hannah did was morally wrong.  It was not wrong&#8212;merely exceptional.  But if this is the case, then one may not argue that parents who do what Hannah did are necessarily sinning!  Hence, something as comparatively minor as sending your child to an age-segregated Sunday School class cannot be sin.</p>
<p>Third, when the example of Samuel is set alongside those of Jesus and Paul, it is hard to resist the impression that the Jews did not interpret the commands about raising their children in the same way that the family-integrated folks do.  They quote the passages addressed to the Jews and Jewish and Gentile Christians in the Bible and conclude that letting your children be taught Christianity by others in your absence is generally wrong.  It seems that Hannah, the Jewish teachers in the Temple, and Paul&#8217;s Jewish parents were unaware of this implication.</p>
