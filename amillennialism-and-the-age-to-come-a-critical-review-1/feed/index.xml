Dana,
I share your enthusiasm to read Dr. Waldron&#039;s review of this work. I also share your locale. I live in Santa Clarita. Not sure where you are fellowshipping while you are at TMU, but if you are looking for a Reformed Baptist community we meet right around the corner. www.cbcscv.com

Grace and Peace!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for addressing this book. I am a student at The Master&#039;s College and was given a copy from a brother (who I have been sharing the two age schema with) and he feels this is the strongest refutation to ammilenialsim to date. curiously, outside of the 1 critical Amazon review, there is virtual radio silence from the normal ammilenial channels that I know of. I really found that strange indeed our disponsational brother is any barometer of others opinions inside that camp. I sincerely look forward to your critique. Thanks Dr. Waldron!]]></description>
