					<description><![CDATA[&quot;We must allow people to be logically inconsistent with their basically orthodox views of justification in their inadequate views of the Covenant of Works.  Of course, we must point out to them the danger in their inconsistent views of the Covenant of Works, but we must not accuse them of actually holding views which we think their errors logically lead to.  People are inconsistent.&quot;

Thank you for this well-put reminder. I look forward to the series.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Waldron is consistently kind and irenic in his approach to polemical work.  He wrote, &quot;We must allow people to be logically inconsistent with their basically orthodox views . . .&quot;  His humility is always at play when he interacts with difficult subject matter.  Certainly, the Reformed Baptist view of the Covenant of Works is an essential element to a number of cascading, important Bible doctrines.  We must, however, remember that many of our people have been subjected to such poor teaching in particular, and a non-thinking church culture in general, that great patience is required to correct erroneous views.  Never back away from truth, never lose heart, and never lose the fruit of God&#039;s indwelling Spirit as we teach God&#039;s Word.  CBTS is involved in the difficult task of training men to this work, and Dr. Waldron is a humble and brilliant example for us all.]]></description>
