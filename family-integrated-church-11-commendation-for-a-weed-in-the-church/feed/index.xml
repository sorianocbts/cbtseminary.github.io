					<description><![CDATA[Greetings,

Sorry for the ugly link above; here&#039;s a cleaner one:
http://www.weswhite.net/2011/04/family-integrated-mathis/

I am interacting with a current church member of Mr. Brown&#039;s church plant and one-time intern and current employee of the NCFIC at wes white&#039;s site above (under Rejoinder to Recent FIC Comments).

I have written a review of Mr. Brown&#039;s book. I also have extensive historical background on Christian education contrary to his books thesis at my blog.

I think our approaches can be quite supplementary. Please feel free to email for more details.

thank you,]]></description>
