Owen,
I don&#039;t know if Waymeyer would agree or not, but that is beside the point.  The fact is that he can&#039;t.  Either prophetic foreshortening applies to New Testament prophecy, or it does not. If prophetic foreshortening applies to all New Testament prophecy, then my criticism holds. If it does not apply to all New Testament prophecy, then Waymeyer has to show why not and where prophetic foreshortening ceases to be a reality in New Testament prophecy.  He makes no such attempt, and I really do not see how he can, given his principles.

Further, if Waymeyer refuses to apply it to the Boook of Revelation, for instance, then we are left with the conundrum that the fullest explanation of eschatology is given to us in apocalyptic and prophetic genre which requires interpretation by the clear and literal passages of the Bible, as I will show in future posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wouldn&#039;t  Waymeyer agree that we today don&#039;t have this foreshortening since by the end of the writing of the NT (AD 90-ish) such gaps had been fully revealed? I imagine he&#039;d say that Christ began to reveal those gaps in His ministry as we see in passages like Matthew 13, and then when John wrote Revelation all such gaps were removed so that no such foreshortening remains for us.]]></description>

John 1:29 clearly assumes John&#039;s reception of Jesus as the Messiah. Who else did he think the Lamb of God would be?  The Messiah is the one who would usher in the coming of the kingdom.  It is clear from many other passages that John did receive Jesus this way.  I could have cited the end of Matthew 3 where John clearly assumes that Jesus is the Messiah in the context of glorious predictions of the coming of the kingdom. This is not front loading my theology of the kingdom. It is simply not buying into the distinctions without a difference so characteristic of Dispensationalism on this issue.  ]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Sam,

You wrote,

&quot;John the Baptist gladly embraced Jesus as the one who would usher in the glorious and irresistible coming of the kingdom (John 1:29).&quot;

But that verse says nothing of the kingdom directly, but rather, &quot;The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, &quot;Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!&quot;

Aren&#039;t you front loading your theology of the kingdom into your critique, from texts that weren&#039;t written to teach it? One might be justified for wondering why you cite the gospel of John as teaching a theology of the kingdom when it doesn&#039;t appear to be a prominent feature in the 4th gospel, since the word appears but three times in twenty-two chapters.]]></description>
