					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for pointing this out. My home church has no staffed nursery, and it is one of the reasons I have not been attending. I have a young toddler who learned to walk at the age of 10 months. While people remarked that he is well-behaved in church, it takes all of my attention to keep him reasonably still and distracted so he is not talking, screaming, or running around. I wasn&#039;t really able to pay attention to the sermon, and I worried that my son was distracting others, so I am waiting until he is old enough to be still and quiet for an hour at a time before we return.]]></description>
