					<description><![CDATA[In my limited study, I have come to the same conlcusion: that the filioque controversy has been inflated. The Western doctrine that added the filioque (if rightly understood) seems to be the the same as the Eastern doctrine that refuses the filioque (if rightly understood). Both the addition and the refusal can be argued in the cause of avoiding seperate heresies.

If this is the case, I have sometimes thought that Western Christians ought to drop the filioqe out of deference to the East and in an attempt to find reconciliation and unity. 

Do you think that dropping the filioque would be doctrinally unwise? 

As Reformed Baptists (in the US) do you think that East-West reconciliation and unity are things to be sought after? More specifically, do you think that dropping the filioque would effectively work towards deep and lasting East-West reconciliation and unity?]]></description>
