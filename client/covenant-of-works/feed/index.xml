					<description><![CDATA[re: &quot;Iâ€™m still not convinced of the idea that Adamâ€™s obedience would have gained his children eternal life -&quot;

-Is this a joke? If it is, and I&#039;m stupidly missing it, I apologize. Otherwise, Adam is not much of a federal head if his actions do not gain benefits or detriments for his posterity. But we know that his sin DID gain condemnation unto death for the entire race. Did he only become a federal head upon his sin? Obviously, his obedience under the covenant of works would have gained life for humanity.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Dr. Waldron for this lecture. It was very helpful in working through some of the issues for me. I am one who has had reservations (I won&#039;t call them objections) with the idea that Adam had not yet eaten of the tree of life. I have presented my questions to a few different audiences without much response. I&#039;m happy to say that your lecture adequately answered my questions on that point, so thank you!

I&#039;m still not convinced of the idea that Adam&#039;s obedience would have gained his children eternal life - so perhaps you can address that in more depth the next time you have opportunity to teach on the subject ;)]]></description>
