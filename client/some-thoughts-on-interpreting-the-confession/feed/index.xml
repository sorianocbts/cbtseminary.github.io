					<description><![CDATA[Brother Bodner is correct.  While we are all very indebted to Dr. Waldron’s Modern Exposition of the confession, we need an exposition that explains the confession within its own historical (17th century English puritanism) to aid us in a full understanding of our statement of faith.

					<description><![CDATA[Dear Dr. Barcellos:

I greatly appreciate these important comments about understanding the Confession we share.  It is particularly important for us as Reformed Bapsists committed to this Confession to gain a mature understanding of the features mentioned in your final principle, #7. 

By and large, I think we do not grasp as fully as we need to, the historical context in which the Confession emerged, whether in terms of issues addressed at that time, or in terms of the theological spectrum within which the framers thought, wrote, preached and debated. 

During the last General Assembly of the ARBCA, this is a point I tried to make (perhaps nto very well) in discussing our Association&#039;s position paper on worship.  It seems clear at least to me, that the way in which the framers conceived and practised the &quot;regulative principle&quot; is quite distinct from the commonly received idea shared by our own and other Reformed Baptist churches.  It is not necessarily wrong for churches of our present day to re-assess, and re-interpret this concept in light of their own experience or context.  However, it is misleading for us to assume our understanding is that of the framers.  I for one am quite sure it is not.  And if I read Hercules Collins&#039; 1680 Catechism, John Gill&#039;s Body of Divinity, comments in Andrew Fuller&#039;s letters, and C.H. Spurgeon&#039;s statements in his sermosn and Autobiography, coreectly, they also do not share the current outlook.  We do not need to break fellowship voer such a point, any more than we would over the Confessional view of the Pope as Antichrist; but the same candour that admits that difference should acknowledge this difference too.  And, just as the few who would accept the original view on the Papacy should be welcome within the ARBCA fold, so should the few who may believe and practice the original view on worship. So think I, at least, for obviously self-serving reasons. 

I hope that some real scholarship could be applied to placing the entire Confession in a detailed historical and theological context in coming years.  If ever I had the privilege and opportunity of doing doctoral work, that is what I would go after.

Every blessing to you in your service to King Jesus,

Yours by His grace,

JPBodner - Hope Assembly, Mississauga, ON, Canada.]]></description>
