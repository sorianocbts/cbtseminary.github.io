The concept of dramatic cyclical progressive parallelism is likely the same thing Dr Waldron is referring to when he uses the phrase redemptive-historical, modified idealism. This also seems to be the view of GK Beale and William Hendriksen.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Labels are necessary but can be dangerous and misleading, causing interpreters to exclude some aspects of the truth. I am Amillenial (In-millenial), partially preterist in that I believe that judgment of A.D 70 foreshadowed the trials and tribulations of the second coming of Christ. (The disciples believed that the destruction of the temple meant the end of the age but they were wrong). However, I believe that Revelation was written after A.D. 70 and is a form of dramatic cyclical progressive parallelism, which is not historicist or futurist but also not essentially idealist.

Since prophecy was given to forewarn the elect so that they would be forearmed to avoid deception, to hyper-spiritualize key elements like the identity of the Antichrist (papal Rome and its Babylonian daughters), is to miss out on the key element of prophecy, and to be a deficient watchman and an uncertain bugler of the battle. So what is my label: &quot;Realistic In-millenialist.&quot;]]></description>
