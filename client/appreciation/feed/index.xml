					<description><![CDATA[I am indebted to Mr. Waldron and his work writing such a helpful exposition on the 2nd London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689. I thank the Lord Jesus Christ for using men like Mr. Waldron and the men of the NCFIC to help me understand the great doctrines of the faith and to apply them practically in life for the glory of God! One thing I would like to clarify in regards to Mr. Waldron&#039;s statement, &quot;the more moderate wing of this movement&quot; referring to the family-integrated model. What is happening is not a &quot;movement&quot; but it&#039;s a &quot;move&quot; of the Spirit of God! It is a reformation of the family to God and the church back to her original place in worship, evangelism, and discipleship. Praise the Lord for His faithfulness to such a worm a man as I.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pastor Waldron,

Thank you for your comments. As a pastor of a Reformed Baptist church in Maryland which is also family-integrated, I whole-heartedly affirm our 1689 confession of faith and the priority of the local church in the life of the believer (both single and married). I am hopeful that your blog will go a long way in removing suspicions in the minds of those brethren who do not fully embrace our philosophy of ministry.

					<description><![CDATA[Pastor Sam.

I am glad to hear this. I have long had an appreciation for such men as Scott Brown and have been saddened by the blanket disapproval by many Reformed Baptists of the FIC as a whole (often out of ignorance). I suspect you will have some concerns expressed (as I do), yet I think these acknowledgements will go a long way (I hope) to build a bridge between the two camps.
