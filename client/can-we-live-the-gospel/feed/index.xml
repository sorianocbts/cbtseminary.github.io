					<description><![CDATA[I think this is an extension/logical conclusion of the emphasis of personal testimony and what Christ has done for making my life better over the declaration of what Christ did in history which is the Gospel.  While admittedly I am not the man I once was, if you follow me around long enough, my life will not &quot;preach the gospel&quot;.  The Gospel is declared, it is received, it is outside of me; I, as has been stated, live in the light of the Gospel.  The gospel is primarily and essentially believing/trusting the historical facts about the Lord Jesus Christ. It is also the motivation for life because I can finally look at the law, agree with it and try to do it and take comfort in the fact that when I don&#039;t, Jesus paid for those sins.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[My concern is gospel clarity and keeping what God has not joined together apart. The gospel is something we believe; the law is something we do. I think discussions like this can sharpen us and help us maintain distinctions where they are necessary.

Steve, I think if Spurgeon lived in the midst of the New Perspective and the Federal Vision he might not have said what he said.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Someone said recently, ‚ÄúThe gospel is not lived but told.‚Äù I think all should agree with that. The gospel is, after all, a declaration of what God has done in Christ for sinners. It is a message about historical facts concerning the sufferings and glory of the Messiah. The gospel is not &quot;husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church&quot; or &quot;love God with all your heart...&quot;

Though I am sure folks mean by ‚Äúliving the gospel‚Äù ‚Äúliving in light of the gospel,‚Äù I think the ellipsis is potentially dangerous, unnecessary, and over a period of time may cause a confusion of categories that must be kept distinct.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Try to make church fellowship full of life and love by preaching and living the gospel of love and brotherhood.-CH Spurgeon

Is not this the thing that weakens the preaching, of the gospel ‚Äî the want of living the gospel? CH Spugeon

Then what does Spurgeon mean in the above quote?]]></description>
