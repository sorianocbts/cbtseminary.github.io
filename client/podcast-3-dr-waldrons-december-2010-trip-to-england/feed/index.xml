					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Waldron,
You&#039;re scratching where I itch. This was the question that I was left desiring more clarity upon after reading your thesis on Faith, Obedience, and Justification. I too would like to know if I could purchase a copy of this Westminster paper.
Thank you for your continuing clarity in writing.
