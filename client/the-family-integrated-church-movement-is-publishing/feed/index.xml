					<description><![CDATA[Sam,
I agree with Bob G&#039;s assessment that you are one of the clearest thinkers I know of, applying sound and Biblical reasoning to questions that arise. I appreciate you taking on this issue, and will seek to remember to pray for you, as you have stepped into a mine field among people who I have found will often be vehement in their opposition and will insist that only their view of the church is right, while building it on scanty proof-texts and poor hermeneutics. Blessings to you in your work,for helping to define a broadly Biblical definition of the church that does not improperly bind men&#039;s consciences.  -- Dennis Gundersen]]></description>
