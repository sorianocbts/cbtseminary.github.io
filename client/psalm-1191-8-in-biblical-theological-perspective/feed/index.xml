					<description><![CDATA[I especially like the idea that Jesus was praying the Psalms as He was battling sin and temptation. I often forget that He faced far greater temptation than I ever have or will. I know what it is to battle great temptation and I am VERY encouraged to remember that He knows what that is like also and is very sympathetic. Good stuff.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is the music of my soul the new song GOD has put in my heart as well.I agree with every line of it because I believe it to be a correct Biblical understaning as taught by the Holy Spirit and not because of what the best of men may teach.The prayer of my heart Dear Brother is that our Brethren would more and more believe the WORD of GOD because the Holy Spirit has enlightened them through GODS gift to His Churches our Dear Under Shepherds/Teachers.Not just because Pator so and so said it so it must be true and hopefully what Pastor teaches is true always but he is not the reason I believe it only a means by which the understaning is helped.Keep the good stuff coming I enjoy the Blog round table comments.GBU Be A Berean Always,Acts 17:11]]></description>
