					<description><![CDATA[There is no joy in Christopher Hitchens&#039; refusal to pray.  The heart is desperately wicked and easily hardened.  No pithy aphorism about how Hitchens is &quot;getting what&#039;s coming to him&quot; is necessary or appropriate among believers.  The article records Hitchens as saying, &quot;All of us are dying.&quot;  That is true.  Some are dying physically only, while others are dying physically and spiritually.  Those who have been born from above will one day graduate from this earthly tent.  Sin and death will lose its last weak hold on them.  The latter group is dead while they live.  They go from death to death.]]></description>
