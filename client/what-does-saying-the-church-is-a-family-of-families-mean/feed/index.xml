					<description><![CDATA[I currently serve as a deacon in Grace family Baptist Church, where Voddie Baucham serves as one of our (three) elders. Before I attended GfBC, I asked the elders what they meant by the phrase, &quot;family of families&quot;. It was explained to me then - and demonstrated to me weekly since joining the church - that the family is the means of discipleship. Parents - primarily fathers - are trained to lead their families. The church helps and supports members and their families as well as requires member&#039;s families to help and support them. It is the most family supportive church I&#039;ve been a part of, yet clearly biblical, reformed, and Baptist in its structure and organization and operation. Not perfect by any shot, but God honoring in intent and effort. I am a joyful part of GfBC, as is my wife.]]></description>
