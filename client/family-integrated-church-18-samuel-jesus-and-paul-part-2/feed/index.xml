					<description><![CDATA[What is more, Christ was left alone for upwards of three days without his parents. And he was still under their authority (v.51). 

The case of Samuel being fostered by another may be exception but by moral reasoning, a fortiori, if it is occasionally acceptable then lesser intense events (say 1 hour SS a week!) is morally permissible.

And Nehemiah&#039;s assembly strongly suggests a differentiation between those who &quot;hear with understanding&quot; being brought and, presumably, those who could not were left behind. 

Other examples of non-parental instruction or oversight: 

Mothers nursed other children (Ex.2:7, Ruth 4:16)  
2 Sam. 4:4, Mephibosheth, the child was five years old when his nurse took him and fled.
2 Kings 12:1-3 notes the teaching influence of the priest, Jehoiada over the child-king Jehoash (even though his mother was alive).]]></description>
