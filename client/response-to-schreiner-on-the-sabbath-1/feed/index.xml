					<description><![CDATA[This is very well said - thank you for bringing some clarity to the issue. As one who has frequently engaged those who hold to Schreiner&#039;s (or similar) position, I find that there is more often than not a great misunderstanding of the Sabbatarian position. To state bluntly and clearly that the Old Covenant, Jewish Sabbath given at the law functioned much differently than the Lord&#039;s Day, in that it too contained many types and shadows, will be very helpful to the discussion. 

I look forward to future posts.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, one can affirm, along with Dr. Schreiner, temporary aspects of the Sabbath under the old covenant that have served their purpose and are no longer required for the people of God, and yet still affirm an abiding requirement for Christians to keep the Sabbath&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Very much agree Richard. I think there is really a lot more agreement on this than disagreement, the problem is in nomenclatures. What does the word &quot;Sabbath&quot; mean? For some it is the Fourth Commandment and they react against it. But at the same time they still attend church weekly and would probably correct someone who didn&#039;t.

For others, &quot;Sabbath&quot; is a commandment to rest and worship. Likewise they worship weekly and would correct someone who doesn&#039;t.

The fact that the Sabbath antedates the Law in creation and also in application indicates to me that it must mean more than just the Old Covenant application of it. As has been observed, it is rooted in God&#039;s creation so it is something that has existed as long as the earth. But it is also applied before the institution of the Ten Commandments in Exodus 16. So it seems that it CANNOT be tied solely to the OC.

I thought Phillips&#039; observation that we interpret the OT via the NT was spot on in this and I wasn&#039;t impressed by the argument that we now observe the Lord&#039;s Day not the Sabbath.

But like you said, there are aspects of the Sabbath that were added in the OC that have been done away with. We must observe the Sabbath in a NC fashion. We learn that from the Apostles and the NT.]]></description>
