					<description><![CDATA[Thanks again.  I&#039;ll check those out, also.  I&#039;ve looked at the TOC at Amazon for the Plummer book and it has peaked my interest.

In addition to Berkhof, I already have Bernard Ramm, though I&#039;ve not yet read him.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[These come from my hermeneutics lectures at MCTS. I might do something with some of this material in the years to come.

I like Berkhof, though I disagree with his assessment of post-Reformation Reformed Orthodoxy (i.e. Scholasticism). There is much good stuff there, though. I like Plummer&#039;s new one - 40 Questions About Intepreting the Bible.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. B -

I wonder if you might have any end goals with respect to this hermeneutics series?  Would you consider putting your thoughts into a hermeneutics manual of some sort once the series is concluded?

Also, is there a basic overview text that you would recommend?  I believer Dr. Malone prefers Berkhof.

Thanks,

Andrew]]></description>
