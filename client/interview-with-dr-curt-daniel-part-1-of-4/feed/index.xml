					<description><![CDATA[Dear Brother Waldron,
Your blogsite has recently come to my attention and I thank you for keeping the topic of general human responsibility for sin and the general call to repentance and faith as a corollary of grace open to the public eye. However, are you correct in your interpretation of the 2LBC 7:2 and 14:3? You will know that the devout authors saw that the call to repentance and faith was wrongly placed in the Westminster Confession so they moved it to where it no doubt belonged in Chapter 7 on the calling within the Covenant of Grace. This is where our Reformers, The Marrow Men, Gill and Huntington placed it, too. Gill preached that God calls sinners to repentance and faith within His Covenant Promise that whoever calls on His Son in true ‘evangelical repentance’, shall be graciously saved. What is Hyper-Calvinistic here?
Furthermore, Chap. 14:3 clearly teaches a distinction between Common Grace and Saving faith, a distinction which Gill, Huntington and a number of those you appear to consider ‘Hypers’ also made. This distinction is not always kept amongst those who oppose Gill such as John Murray (a non-Baptist) and Eroll Hulse (a Baptist). In other words, all gospel overtures are not included in God’s general Providence (common grace). We would not expect it to be otherwise, given God’s special revelation concerning the need for repentance and faith. 
Daniel majors on Gill’s allegedly not believing in human responsibility and the general call to repentance and faith, though he has never documented this hypothesis.  However, Gill emphasised these aspects arguably more than his contemporaries as, for example, in his Body of Divinity: Vol. II, Of Effectual Calling. You may also have noticed that Daniel and Oliver were the odd-men-out in Haykin’s Life and Thought of John Gill which otherwise kept to a better documented, positive, view of Gill as an evangelist. There are several recent doctoral theses on Gill which confirm that the Fullerite position on Gill is groundless and that Fuller, himself, followed Gill in his doctrine of man’s responsibility. Modern Fullerites are thus ‘Hyper-Fullerites’.
Yours sincerely in Christ,

George M. Ella]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Keith, you asked about my reference to &quot;half-step hyper-Calvinism.&quot;  I regard the denial of duty-faith as full Hyper-Calvinism.    By half-step Hyper-Calvinism I refer here to the Protestant Reformed Churches and Herman Hoeksema  who, while they affirm that God commands the non-elect to repent, yet historically deny the free offer of the gospel, the well-meant offer of the gospel, and common grace.  Both common grace and the free offer are clearly affirmed by the 1689.  Thus, the 1689 by clear implication and the Canons of Dort straightforwardly affirm the well-meant offer of the gospel.]]></description>
