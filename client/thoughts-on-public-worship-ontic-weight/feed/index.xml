					<description><![CDATA[Eddie I&#039;m fresh out of gernades but I&#039;ll launch a Bible missle at you in love of course. Look out here it comes! Bear with me if I&#039;m not a mature skilled exigete but it seems to me that God has always put an important distinction between the common and the sacred when it comes to His corporate Worship in the OT era. And in His Heavenly realm as well. The NT seems to me to continue to put a distiction between common gatherings and sacred gaterings. The Lords Day if you hold to that teaching is a special day compared to the rest of the week.The early Church made a clear distinction that bacame much more pronounced as the Church matured. I believe Christ is always with me by the Holy Spirit in Faith or by Faith He dwells in my soul/heart my spirit. The NT displays a glimpse or two of what I think is a special presence in the Gathered Body/Church on the Lords Day. Revelation 1:10 to 2:1 What is meant by IN THE MIDST of the seven gloden lampstands? In these specific Churches sound like a presence to me of different assemblies in Asia. 2 Cor.6,16 likewise speaks of Him GOD walking amoung us. What is Paul implying when he tells Timothy in 1 Tim. 3:15 Is not everything revealed in the Revelation of Christ a reality in the gathered Church  though not fully known as it shall be in the full manifestation of the Kingdom? Acts it seems to me puts a high priority on the assembled church and what the Lord does in the corporate gathering. Acts 1:4 &quot; being assembled&quot;. The meet to chose Judas &#039;s succesor Acts 1:15 to 26&#062; Acts 2:1 &quot;in one place&quot; &quot;filled the whole house where they were siting&quot; they as in many in one place being moved upon by His Spirits presence. I won&#039;t gone on any further but it seems to me that much of the book of Acts displays a consistant revelation of His presence by the Holy Spirit the Father included in the Triune presence all through the NT as in the old and in Heaven and in the world to a point.In Him we live and move and have our being. But the gathered Church on the Lords Day is it seems obviously a unique seting and therefore knows a special presence seperate from the disasembled members and the ones outside of the Church. The Lords Supper is  a point in case in my understanding which I believe was partaken of every Lords Day when possible. A weak point in Reformed Baptist circles in my humble opinion. I sense a uniquness in this Ordinance just as at a Baptismal service or Wedding. It may be some remnants of my Roman Catholic upbringing that influences some of this but I think not. I will become a listener now and here your thoughts on this,please do share on what I have commented on I want to learn and be a Berean. In Christ,Stephen]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t see a single NT/NC text that teaches this and certainly Richard W. Daniels, the context of Matth. 18 is church discipline and not corporate worship.

I don&#039;t find this view offensive mind you, just don&#039;t see it taught in the NT as a &#039;special presence&#039;, this seems to me to be an OT approach to NT worship. 

Please, not grenades. :)&#062;  I&#039;d love to see the exegetical reasoning beyond OT proofs for this.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[There is no doubt about it, there is a Spiritual dynamic which is unique to the gathered Church the Body Of Christ for the purpose of things done only as we gather corporately. We all know that the Body is not disjointed when we disasemble on the Lords Day,the body is still One in Christ our One Head. I think we represent the whole Christ or His body where ever we go as members in particular so in that sense weightyness attends us all as we live out each day.This to me is why it is so important that we represent Him who we are to walk before in a worty manner.And our brethren who we would either shame or edify by our lives. What we do gathered matters and what we do ungathered matters greatly before GOD and men.Just some thoughts upon my heart.]]></description>
