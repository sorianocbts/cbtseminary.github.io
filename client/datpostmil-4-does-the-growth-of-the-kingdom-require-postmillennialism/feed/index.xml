					<description><![CDATA[The unregenerate are totally self-deceived but in this present evil age, God has  decreed different levels of self-deception in the elect. The apostle Paul was very frustrated with this fact, and so are the true believers who long for glorification. Romans 7; 8; Philippians 3. We, who have tasted of the age to come, want more in this imperfect age, and that explains pre-millenialism and its refined version, post-millenialism. 

But we must call out our erring brethren in love, so that we may grow up in grace and knowledge, together, in Christ, and patient waiting for Christ. (James 5:7-8).Usually false teachers, and in this case, errorists, do not explicitly admit their errors, but their errors are clearly implied and can be deduced by necessary consequence. 

We must forcefully articulate to post-millenial errorists that the foretaste of the resurrection glory does not include a global spiritual but physical kingdom of peace, prosperity and righteousness. Papal Rome, the Antichrist, has a similar claim, de facto postmillenialism, but it is easier to be unequally yoked with her or her daughters, liberalism, counterfeit conservatism etc, in the interest of preserving public morality, such as the sanctity of life, marriage and family and religious freedom etc.

Thank and praise God that one day, we will all be glorified reformed covenantal baptists in the new heavens and earth, in which righteousness dwells. We will join John the baptist, the greatest prophet of the OT, and the other Johns, and the apostle Paul the greatest reformed baptist of the NT, but till then... LOL.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think that premillenialists and postmillenialists fall into a similar error of a chiliastic glorious socio-economic and political kingdom of righteousness, peace and prosperity before Christ&#039;s second coming, substantially because they do not envision the profound and pervasive darkness of the OT age, among the Gentile nations of the entire earth, except Israel. They miss the radical discontinuity of the greater glory of the NT gospel millenial last days, in which Satan is bound, in contrast with the OT era in which he was loosed. 

Pedobaptists make a similar category error of covenantal sacralism regarding pedobaptism and pedocommunion, if they are consistent. Charismatics also make a similar error in striving to prolong the transitional glory of the apostolic and prophetic period of miraculous gifts of signs and wonders, until Christ&#039;s second coming. They miss the greater glory of the sufficiency of the completed and closed canon of Scripture.]]></description>
