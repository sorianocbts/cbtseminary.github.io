					<description><![CDATA[Although I would recommend it, you don&#039;t actually have to be a paedobaptist to believe in exclusive psalmody, or in the rejection of musical instruments in New Testament worship. Two of the most recent works defending both of those positions have been written by Reformed Baptists.

Malcolm Watts (minister of Emmanuel Church Salisbury in England), wrote &quot;God&#039;s Hymnbook for the Christian Church&quot; as a response to Iain Murray&#039;s Banner of Truth booklet attacking exclusive psalmody. It is available from the James Begg Society (http://www.nesherchristianresources.org/JBS/publications/info_ghcc.html).

John Price (pastor of Rochester Reformed Baptist Church) authored &quot;Old Light on New Worship,&quot; defending the non-instrumental position. It is available from several different booksellers, including my denomination&#039;s publisher (http://www.crownandcovenant.com/product_p/ds214.htm).]]></description>
