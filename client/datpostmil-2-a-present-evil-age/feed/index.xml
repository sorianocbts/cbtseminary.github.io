					<description><![CDATA[Thank you so much for this explanation! That point about this age being, and always being evil is what has bothered me about postmillennialism. 
So many questions arise for me as I consider postmill thought. In postmill, wouldn&#039;t many people simply become Christians nominally because that would be the norm? If human hearts are still bound in sin, this inevitably happens as history and culture prove. You have answered these biblically]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I agree with the biblical amillenialism which I think should be labelled in-millenialism or inaugurated millenialism. Thanks Pr.

This has been the historical  tendency of the Godly seed of Noah and OT Israel.]]></description>
