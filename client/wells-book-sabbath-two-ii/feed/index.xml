					<description><![CDATA[A case can be made for God&#039;s law, in summary and in detail, existing prior to its being given to Israel after He brought them out of Egypt.

Examples include the following:
The example you have already given: Cain hating his brother and sin at the door at that point (hate is murder in the heart)

Abel and Cain bring offerings to God.  A blood sacrifice is acceptable, while a non-blood sacrifice is not acceptable.

Noah knew the difference between clean and unclean creatures when God directed how many of each would be put on the ark.

God was not pleased with the wickedness that resulted by the intermarriage of His people with the daughters of men.  (I understand the sons of God as those who called upon His name versus the daughters of men, meaning those who were unbelievers).  The wickedness that resulted led to God&#039;s judgment.  This was the sin of Israel later as they did not keep themselves from intermarrying with the people groups surrounding them.

Noah is instructed not to eat the meat with its blood.

Noah is told that whoever sheds man&#039;s blood will pay with his own blood.

Noah builds an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings.  The LORD received this as a sweet smelling aroma.

The LORD destroyed Sodom &#038; Gomorrah for their great wickedness. They were morally accountable to the LORD.

Abraham obeyed the LORD&#039;s voice, charge, commandments, statutes, and laws.  Obviously Abraham was given and responsible for more than has been recorded of him.

Jacob tells his family to put away the strange gods from among them and be clean.  Obviously they knew idolatry was an uncleanness, impurity to the LORD.

Judah&#039;s son is lined up to marry Tamar after his first son died.  When the second son dies, she is sent away to wait for the third son.  The 2nd son&#039;s duty was to raise up offspring to the 1st son who had died.

Joseph would not go in to Potiphar&#039;s wife and commit &quot;sin against God.&quot;

Jacob gives Joseph a double portion. (may be argued against because it is the first born son, even if that wife were hated, to whom this is to be given Deut. 21:15-17)

There are likely others.  These are only the ones which I have seen on my own.  Others better and wiser than me have likely seen more.

There is one more though: the Sabbath was created at a time when there was no sin.  This would mean that it is not a ceremonial.  Jesus says it was made for man.  He never says it was only a covenant sign for Israel.  I don&#039;t deny that it was part of the covenant with Israel, but it existed prior to that covenant being made as Exodus 16 demonstrates.

Its existence in the New Covenant is demonstrated by Revelation 1:10.  A day has the Lord&#039;s name on it, just as a supper has the Lord&#039;s name on it.  Although we are to eat &#038; drink all to the glory of God, there is a meal that is distinct from all other meals.  Also in this way, every day belongs to the Lord, but He has specifically marked one day of the week as particularly belonging to Himself.]]></description>
