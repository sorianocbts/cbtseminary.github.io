					<description><![CDATA[Given the fact that one of the most prominent features of the historicist interpretation is given confessional status in most historic Protestant confessions, including your own (2LBC 26.4), would you be willing at some point to interact with the interpretations offered by Reformed (including Baptistic) Protestants of the past on some of the passages in question?]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Thanks so much for this series of posts Dr. Waldron.  I&#039;ve been preaching through 2 Thessalonians and your books on the end times came in quite handy. I haven&#039;t become a fully convinced amil guy yet, but I definitely feel that the greatest argument centers on the finality of the second coming. I also think that discussing the timing of final judgment reduces the abstract nature of discussions that instead focus on the millennium and it reminds us why this should really matter to all believers. 

Again, let me also express my gratitude for your messages at the Founders Conference earlier this year. I look forward to hearing from you again somewhere down the road.

In Christ,

Bob Browning]]></description>
