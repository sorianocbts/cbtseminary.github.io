I don&#039;t know that there is any settled agreement as to what defines a high-Calvinist or moderate-Calvinist.  High-Calvinism is usually associated with supralapsarianism, so since I am an infralapsarian, I don&#039;t think I necessarily fit into the category.  However, Johnson considers Owen and Turretin to be primary representatives of high-Calvinism, in which case I would definitely fit into the category. Still others might set the border between high and moderate Calvinism at the point of the well-meant offer of the gospel, in which case I&#039;m considered moderate since I staunchly defend it.]]></description>
