Given it does or doesn&#039;t my concern is that most every church has worship and sunday school inseperably linked. THe emphasis seems equal and that the leadership would be overwhelmingly pleased if every worshiper attended the sundsy schol. Application of the regulative principle helps to examine this extra meeting. Other corporate gatherings are not so linked to the corporate worphip.]]></description>
