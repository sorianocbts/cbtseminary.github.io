					<description><![CDATA[Pastor Sam,

Thank you. Well said. I agree. May there be more unity between us as confessional baptists as the result.

Shawn Mathis,

I do not believe their articles &quot;throw us under the bus.&quot; Every church has the right to specify their views. If a church was convinced age segregated practices are unbiblical that is their right. Just as much as it is ours to decide they are biblical (or at least not unbiblical). Can we not hold to our differences strongly yet allow for differences? Can we not be unified in the confession and differ on such matters. We do so in our assembly.  

I pray this may be true with regards to the church in general.]]></description>
