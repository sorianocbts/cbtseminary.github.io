					<description><![CDATA[John asked: &quot;Should a church even have an official constitution, if the elders don’t enforce its articles and the members don’t adhere to it in practice?&quot; Great question. Constitutions function to provide specific ways in which churches carry out various practical aspects of being a church. However, they can become a formality. As far as sporadic attendance goes, each case must be considered on its own. It may get to the point where a church member who is not fulfilling the requirements of membership should be asked to consider transferring membership to a church where he could better fulfill requirements. The first step would be to determine why the sporadic attendance. The next step should be to encourage to live up to membership committments given voluntarily when joining the church. The last step would be to suggest going elsewhere. If the member refuses to live up to agreement and will not leave, he would be very disorderly at that point.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Should a church even have an official constitution, if the elders don&#039;t enforce its articles and the members don&#039;t adhere to it in practice?  For example: a church&#039;s constitution may require attendance by members to attend all the stated meetings on the Lord&#039;s day, unless providencially hindered.  I&#039;ve witnessed examples where some members will attend very inconsistently all the meetings week by week.  They will attend usually at least one meeting on the Lord&#039;s day and perhaps a prayer meeting mid-week without being providencially hindered.  Basically, their attendance is arbitrarily to how they feel on a particular day and/or week.  This will go on for years without being addressed by the church elders.  If it is addressed, it&#039;s not enforced any further than a warning.

Church discipline seems to be reserved for apparently more serious sins, like adultery, or drunkenness.  Why have a constitution if it&#039;s not upheld by the church?]]></description>
