He will be covering hermeneutics while I will handle worldviews.</p>
<p>Please pray for us! In training these pastors, we have a wonderful opportunity but also a humbling responsibility entrusted to us. To help you in your prayers, I have included below my course syllabus. May we glorify Christ through the equipping of His people for the growth of His kingdom!</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Christianity and Its Competitors:</strong><br />
<em>Contending for the Christian Worldview</em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Course Purpose</strong><br />
The purpose of this course is to equip each pastor and church leader to &#8220;hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it&#8221; (Titus 1:9).  This will be accomplished through establishing a Biblical foundation of contending for the faith, explaining the Christian worldview, and evaluating other competing worldviews.</p>
<p><strong>Course Reading</strong><br />
James W. Sire, <em>Scripture Twisting: 20 Ways the Cults Misread the Bible</em> (Downers Grove IL, USA: Intervarsity Press, 1980).<br />
Richard Gehman, <em>Who are the Living Dead? A Theology of Death, Life After Death and the Living-Dead</em> (Nairobi, Kenya: Evangel Publishing House, 1999).</p>
<p><strong>Course Requirements</strong><br />
<em> Four Quizzes</em>: each quiz is worth 25 points, 100 points total<br />
A quiz will be given each day on Tuesday through Friday covering the previous day&#8217;s lectures.  The quizzes will have multiple choice, true or false, matching, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, and listing questions included.  Together, they will cover all of the lecture material for the course.</p>
<p><em>Final Exam</em>: each essay is worth 50 points, 100 points total<br />
A final exam will assess overall competence in the topics covered in the course. Two essay questions will be completed which integrate the course reading with critical reflection on the lecture content and supplemental material.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Final Essay Questions</span><br />
1)	Using Sire&#8217;s <em>Scripture Twisting</em>, select ten Scripture reading errors. For each misreading, identify and define it, give an example of it from the lectures or supplemental materials (<em>not</em> included in Sire&#8217;s book), and provide a biblical response. 5 pages minimum.<br />
2)	Summarize and compare the theology of death, life after death, and the living-dead between three worldviews: 1) African Traditional Religion (using Gehman&#8217;s <em>Who are the Living Dead?</em>), 2) a Christian competitor (chosen from the course lectures or the supplemental materials), and 3) the biblical worldview. 5 pages minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Course Evaluation</strong><br />
The student&#8217;s final grade will be determined by dividing his total points earned in half. A student will have successfully completed this course by achieving a cumulative grade of 75 percent or above for his course work. The letter equivalents for the percentile grades assigned are as follows:</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion: <strong>Gospel Texts on Sabbath-Keeping</strong></strong></p>
<p>A detailed examination of all the passages in the Gospels where Christ discusses the issue of the Sabbath will show that he never predicted its abolition, nor did he ever profane it. If fact, he could not profane it, nor advocate its profanation by others, without sinning. He was born under the law, not to profane it, but to keep it (Gal. 4:5). If Christ violated the Sabbath, then he sinned and would not be a suitable Savior for others. Instead, he advocated works of necessity (Matt. 12:1-8; Mk. 2:23-28; Lk. 6:1-5), mercy (Matt. 12:9-14; Mk. 3:1-6; Lk. 4:31-41; 6:6-11; 13:10-17; 14:1-6; Jn. 5:8-10; 7:23; 9:13-16), and piety (Matt. 12:9; Mk. 6:2; Lk. 4:16; 6:6; Jn. 7:22-23) on the Sabbath by his teaching and example. He never violated it, advocated its violation by others, or prophesied its soon demise. In fact, Mk. 2:27-28 prophesies the perpetuity of the Sabbath under his lordship as Son of Man.</p>
<p>Both Matt. 12:1-14 and Mk. 2:27-28 contain transcovenantal principles relating to the Sabbath. Works of mercy and necessity are lawful on the Sabbath, linking Jesus’ teaching with revelation given prior to his earthly ministry (i.e., the OT). Jesus as Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath, linking the Sabbath and its Lord with future revelation (i.e., the NT). Jesus’ teaching on the Sabbath leaves us with the expectation that he will execute his lordship over the Sabbath in the future, during the inter-advental days of the new covenant. His teaching on the Sabbath is related to antecedent revelation (explicitly) and subsequent revelation (implicitly). It establishes a basis for its basic ethical perpetuity and yet in such a way as to expect changes in application due to the redemptive-historical shift that takes place due to his entrance into glory (i.e., resurrection/ascension).</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/2011/05/wells-on-sabb-chapt-three-iv/">Tom Wells&#8217; book on the Sabbath: Chapter Three (IV)</a></p>
<p>Mark 2:23-28 narrates another incident between Jesus and his disciples and the Pharisees. Jesus was &#8220;passing through the grainfields on the Sabbath, and His disciples began to make their way along while picking the heads of grain&#8221; (Mk. 2:23). The Pharisees said, &#8220;Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath?&#8221; (Mk. 2:24). This is the regulating question Jesus answers in this passage. According to the Pharisees&#8217; understanding, Christ&#8217;s disciples were violating the law of God by doing that which was, in their words, &#8220;not lawful on the Sabbath&#8221; (Mk. 2:24). Christ, as in Matt. 12:3-4, brings up the example of David and his companions entering the house of God and doing that &#8220;which [was] not lawful&#8230;&#8221; (Mk. 2:26). In Matt. 12:7, he pronounced his disciples innocent. In Matt. 12:12, Jesus said, &#8220;So then, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221; Though he does not pronounce his disciples innocent in Mark 2, he uses David and his companions as an example of someone in Scripture doing a similar thing his disciples were doing. It seems obvious that if his disciples were innocent in one text (Matt. 12), they are innocent in another (Mk. 2).[1] But how were they innocent? Did they, in fact, do that which was not lawful on the Sabbath? Obviously, Jesus did not think so in Matthew 12 or here. In Jesus&#8217; mind, they did that which was lawful. It was lawful because God desires compassion or mercy over sacrifice (cf. Matt. 12:7). In other words, Jesus makes a distinction between aspects of the Old Testament&#8217;s laws. Mercy overrules the positive aspects of the Sabbath under the old covenant.[2]</p>
<p>In Mk. 2:27, Jesus does as Paul and Moses do elsewhere. He draws a principle from creation that is germane to mankind (cf. Exod. 20:8-11 and 1 Tim. 2:12-13). Mark 2:27-28 says, &#8220;And He said to them, &#8216;The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath. Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath.&#8217;&#8221; <em>First</em>, note that both man and Sabbath are said to be made. The verb used by Mark in v. 27, evge,neto (&#8220;made&#8221;), comes from gi,nomai, which means &#8216;to become&#8217; or &#8216;to be.&#8217; It is the same verb used in Jn. 1:3, where it is translated &#8220;made.&#8221; There it refers to the creation of all things through the Word. What Jesus is saying in Mk. 2:27 is that, in the past, both man and the Sabbath came into being (i.e., &#8216;were made&#8217;) and that coming into being is described by one verb. This leads us to the conclusion that man and Sabbath were made at the same time. It would be quite clumsy to separate the making of man and the making of the Sabbath by hundreds and maybe even thousands of years by placing the Sabbath&#8217;s birth after Israel&#8217;s deliverance from Egypt in Exod. 16 or 20. Since we know that man was created (i.e., &#8216;came into being&#8217;) according to Gen. 1 and 2 in the Garden of Eden, Christ would have us to conclude that the Sabbath, as he refers to it here, was made at the same time and in the same place (cf. Exod. 20:11). This relates Christ&#8217;s teaching on the Sabbath with previous revelation.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, both Sabbath and man are singular and articular in the Greek text (To. sa,bbaton&#8230; to.n a;nqrwpon [&#8220;the Sabbath&#8230;the man&#8221;]). Both words occur twice in this verse and both words are preceded by an article each time. This is one way to emphasize both Sabbath and man. Jesus did not say &#8220;The Sabbath was made for the Jews&#8221; or &#8220;the Sabbaths[3] were made for the Jews.&#8221; He said &#8220;the Sabbath&#8221; was made for &#8220;the man.&#8221; &#8220;The man&#8221; refers either to Adam as the head of the human race or mankind. Either way, it is clear that Christ goes back to the creation account and sees both man and the Sabbath being made. In context, Christ not only corrects the Pharisees for misunderstanding the Sabbath (Mk. 2:23-24), he, in effect, rebukes their narrow-minded and unbiblical approach to this issue. Jesus teaches us that the Sabbath is not unique to the Jews. God caused it to come into being as he caused Adam and all mankind to come into being for his glory and their good. The Sabbath is as old as man, according to Christ, not merely as old as the Jews. Again, this relates Christ&#8217;s teaching with previous revelation.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, the Sabbath is said to have been &#8220;made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.&#8221; Two observations are worthy to consider. <em>First</em>, &#8220;[t]he Sabbath was made <em>for</em> man.&#8221; It was not made for God. God does not need a Sabbath. We do. It was made by God for our good. <em>Second</em>, man was not made &#8220;for the Sabbath.&#8221; Man existed first. His needs existed before the Sabbath did. The Sabbath came into being to serve man&#8217;s needs to be like God and to enjoy him. We don&#8217;t serve the Sabbath, it serves us so we can serve God better. Again, this relates Christ&#8217;s teaching with previous revelation.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, Christ puts his stamp of Messianic lordship on the Sabbath that was made at creation. &#8220;Therefore the Son of Man is also Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (Mk. 2:28). This provides us with the expectation that the Sabbath will abide under his lordship and will take on characteristics appropriate to this lordship under the new covenant (cf. Rev. 1:10). John Murray comments:</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>What the Lord is affirming is that the Sabbath has its place within the sphere of his messianic lordship and that he exercises lordship over the Sabbath because the Sabbath was made for man. Since he is Lord of the Sabbath it is his to guard it against those distortions and perversions with which Pharisaism had surrounded it and by which its truly beneficent purpose has been defeated. But he is also its Lord to guard and vindicate its permanent place within that messianic lordship which he exercises over all things&#8211;he is Lord of the Sabbath, too. And he is Lord of it, not for the purpose of depriving men of that inestimable benefit which the Sabbath bestows, but for the purpose of bringing to the fullest realization on behalf of men that beneficent design for which the Sabbath was instituted. If the Sabbath was made for man, and if Jesus is the Son of man to save man, surely the lordship which he exercises to that end is not to deprive man of that which was made for his good, but to seal to man that which the Sabbath institution involves. Jesus is Lord of the Sabbath&#8211;we dare not tamper with his authority and we dare not misconstrue the intent of his words.[4]</p>
<p>It is clear from the text in Daniel, where the phrase &#8220;Son of Man&#8221; comes from, that it refers to Christ in the posture of enthronement, immediately following his ascension into glory and is a title appropriate for him during the days in which he is given a kingdom and the nations become his.</p>
<p>I was watching in the night visions, And behold, <em>One </em>like the Son of Man, Coming with the clouds of heaven! He came to the Ancient of Days, And they brought Him near before Him. Then to Him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, That all peoples, nations, and languages should serve Him. His dominion <em>is </em>an everlasting dominion, Which shall not pass away, And His kingdom <em>the one </em>Which shall not be destroyed. (Dan. 7:13-14)</p>
<p>In other words, Christ administrates the Sabbath as the Son of Man during the whole interadvental period&#8211;the days of the new covenant. This relates Chris&#8217;s teaching on the Sabbath with both previous and future revelation. Christ&#8217;s lordship over the Sabbath also implies Christ&#8217;s deity. The Sabbath is God&#8217;s (Isa. 56:4; 58:13). Since Christ is Lord of the Sabbath as Son of Man and since this title is his during the inter-advental days of the new covenant, then we should not be shocked if the Sabbath bears unique characteristics of his lordship under the new covenant. Patrick Fairbairn says:</p>
<p>He is Lord of the Sabbath, and, as such, has a right to order everything concerning it, so as to make it, in the fullest sense, a day of blessing for man&#8211;a right, therefore, if He should see fit, to transfer its observance from the last day of the week to the first, that it might be associated with the consummation of His redemptive work, and to make it, in accordance with the impulsive life and energy thereby brought in, more than in the past, a day of active and hallowed employment for the good of men.[5]</p>
<p>Jesus (Matt. 19:4-5 [and Mk. 2:27-28]), Paul (1 Tim. 2:12-13), and Moses (Exod. 20:11) argue in similar fashion. Each of them goes back to the creation account for the basis of ethics in terms of marriage, divorce, male/female roles in the church, and Sabbath. They all apply the same reasoning, though to different issues. If the basis for their argument is creation, and if creation transcends covenants and cultures, how can we not conclude that what they are arguing for applies to all men at all times, though dependant upon revelation from God in terms of specific application at any given point in redemptive history? In other words, though the application may vary due to various redemptive-historical situations (i.e., divorce permitted due to the entrance of sin, 7<sup>th</sup> day Sabbath to 1<sup>st</sup> day Sabbath/Lord&#8217;s Day, etc.), the principle itself stands. And the reason why it stands is due to the order and ethical implications of creation drawn out by the Bible itself.</p>
<p>If the principle applies to marriage, divorce, and male/female roles in the church, then doesn&#8217;t it still apply to the Sabbath as well? If it does not apply to the Sabbath, upon what grounds is the principle dismissed? If one says, &#8220;The Sabbath was an ordinance for the Jews only. It was theirs&#8217; as God&#8217;s old covenant people to apply to their culture alone in the Promised Land,&#8221; then couldn&#8217;t someone argue the same for male/female roles in the church? They could say, &#8220;Paul was dealing with a culture-relative issue. His reasoning applied to that culture alone. Women, therefore, may have authority over men in the church and may teach and preach to them. Women may be pastors.&#8221; Some in our day argue this way. But when the Bible bases ethics upon creation, the principle applies to all cultures at all times. And until this age gives way to the fullness of the age to come, creation-based ethics (i.e., creation ordinances) are moral laws for all men.</p>
<hr size="1">[1] If Matthew utilized Mark, it could be that he filled out the incident for his own purposes. If Mark used Matthew, it could be that he trimmed the incident because he knew Matthew had dealt with it in detail. If the Gospel writers wrote independent of each other based on eye-witness accounts, each one wrote what they did for authorial purposes. Either way, both texts were inspired by God and can and ought to be used to interpret each other.</p>
<p>[2] See the <em>Second London Baptist Confession</em>, 22:7, where it acknowledges that the Sabbath is &#8220;a positive moral, and perpetual commandment&#8230;&#8221; I take this to mean that the Sabbath can and does take upon itself temporary aspects (i.e., positive laws) during the history of redemption, which can and do change, yet its essence is moral or perpetual. This means that its positive aspects may give way to the moral or perpetual aspects of God&#8217;s law.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><a href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/2011/05/surv-of-hist-herm-ren-ref/">Brief survey of the history of hermeneutics &#8211; 11. Renaissance and Reformation</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>The theological methodology of the post-Reformation Reformed orthodox: </strong>The theological methodology of the post-Reformation Reformed orthodox was, in the first place, exegetical. In order to get a firmer grip on their methodology, we will examine it from the vantage point of <em>what it is not </em>&#8211; 1. a hyper-syllogistic method; 2. an Aristotelian, rationalistic method; and 3. a universal method &#8211; and <em>what it is </em>&#8211; 4. a pre-critical method; 5. an exegetically-based method; 6. a redemptive-historically sensitive method; and 7. a multi-sourced method. The last four mentioned methodological characteristics are especially visible in the writings of John Owen, one of the premiere post-Reformation Reformed scholastics.[1]<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Not a Hyper-Syllogistic Method: </strong>Their method was not reduced to syllogistic argumentation <em>ad nauseam</em>. In fact, Muller claims that &#8220;[f]ew of the orthodox or scholastic Protestants lapsed into constant or exclusive recourse to syllogism as a method of exposition.&#8221;[2] Syllogistic argumentation was utilized, but mostly in polemic contexts and not as an exegetical tool. Logic&#8211;the science of necessary inference&#8211;was utilized by the Reformed orthodox in the drawing out of good and necessary conclusions from the text of Scripture,[3] but it was a servant and not lord of the interpreter. Muller says that &#8220;the drawing of logical conclusions appears as one of the final hermeneutical steps in the [Reformed orthodox exegetical] method&#8230;&#8221;[4]<strong></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Not an Aristotelian, Rationalistic Method: </strong>The Protestant scholasticism of the post-Reformation era must be distinguished from rationalism. The Reformed orthodox did not place human reason above, or even equal to, divine revelation.[5] The place and function of reason was subordinate to the authority of Scripture. Reason was an instrument not an axiomatic principle.[6] The Protestant scholastics utilized a modified (or Christian) Aristotelianism &#8220;that had its beginnings in the thirteenth century.&#8221;[7] Muller explains:<strong></strong></p>
<p>It is important to recognize what this use entailed and what it did not. The Christian Aristotelianism of the Protestant orthodox drew on rules of logic and devices such as the fourfold causality in order to explain and develop their doctrinal formulae&#8212;and only seldom, if ever, to import a full-scale rational metaphysics or physics into their theology. Contrary to what is sometimes claimed, the fourfold causality (i.e., first, formal, material, and final causes) does not imply a particular metaphysic. Specifically, it is not by nature &#8220;determinis&shy;tic.&#8221; One can use the model to delineate the soteriological patterns of the eternal decree of God and its execution in time; one can also use the model to describe the sources and effects of human sinfulness and human moral conduct; or one can use the model to explain how a car&shy;penter makes a table. The large-scale result of Christian Aristotelianism was not, in other words, a fundamentally Aristotelian Christianity: Aristotle would have disowned this hybrid philosophy with its infinite God who created the world out of nothing! There was, certainly, less imposition of rational metaphysics on theology in the seventeenth-century orthodox affirmations of divine eternity, omniscience, and immutability than there is in the twentieth-century claims of a changing God whose very being is in flux and who lacks foreknowledge of future contingency![8]</p>
<p>Van Asselt says, &#8220;[the] facile equation of Scholasticism and Aristotelianism is no longer tenable.&#8221;[9]</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>Not a Universal Method: </strong>As well, simply because an author utilized the scholastic method in some of his writings did not mean he used it in all of them. For instance, Muller offers Beza as an example.[10] Elsewhere, Muller says, &#8220;In the cases of Perkins, Ames, Voetius, and Baxter, works of piety and works of scholastic theology emanated from the same pens.&#8221;[11] Muller goes on to say:<strong></strong></p>
<p>&#8230;there is no clear division between Protestant scholasticism and federal theology. Theologians who wrote works of piety that followed a &#8220;positive&#8221; or &#8220;catechetical&#8221; method also wrote more technical and academic works using the scholastic method &#8211; and many of the scholastic, as well as &#8220;positive&#8221; works were covenantal in their theology.[12]</p>
<p>This observation applies to Johannes Cocceius and John Owen. Owen utilized the scholastic method in some treaties and a more practical, pastoral approach in others. Both Cocceius and Owen utilized the federal model as well as the <em>loci</em> model. Also, within the body of Owen&#8217;s <em>Biblical Theology</em>, he utilizes the scholastic method but also ridicules it.[13] This obviously shows that Owen could use a method he fully realized was abused by others and that the scholastic method was just that&#8211;a method and not a theology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>A Pre-Critical Method: </strong>The Reformed orthodox obviously predate the Enlightenment and the critical assault on the Holy Scriptures. The Enlightenment gave birth to, among other things, a rationalistic approach to the interpretation of Scripture. This can be seen, for instance, in the early developments of biblical theology.[14] Typical Enlightenment rationalism and anti-supernaturalism is evidenced in the following statements made by Benjamin Jowett, a Greek professor at Oxford in the mid-nineteenth century. David C. Steinmetz quotes Jowett and comments:<strong></strong></p>
<p>Jowett argued that &#8220;Scripture has one meaning&#8211;the meaning which it had in the mind of the Prophet or Evangelist who first uttered or wrote, to the hearers or readers who first received it.&#8221;[15] Scripture should be interpreted like any other book and the later accretions and venerated traditions surrounding its interpretation should, for the most part, either be brushed aside or severely discounted. &#8220;The true use of interpretation is to get rid of interpretation, and leave us alone in company with the author.&#8221;[16]</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Jowett obviously reduces meaning to the intent of the human author alone. In critical hermeneutical theory, there was no room whatsoever for the medieval concept of &#8220;double literal sense&#8221;[17] or for the Reformation and post-Reformation concepts of <em>sensus literalis</em> (literal sense), <em>analogia Scripturae </em>(analogy of Scripture), <em>analogia fidei </em>(analogy of faith), and <em>scopus Scripturae </em>(scope of Scripture).[18] In post-modern thought, man, the reader, is king of interpretation; in the modern/Enlightenment theory man, the author, was. In the Middle Ages, however, and in the Reformation and post-Reformation eras, though through differing hermeneutical principles, the meaning of Scripture was not determined by the human author&#8217;s intent alone or the reader. Ultimately, the meaning of Scripture was determined by God, the author of Scripture.[19]</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>An Exegetically-Based Method<strong>[20]</strong>: </strong>Though the Reformed orthodox were confessionally one in a historical sense (i.e., the <em>Belgic Confession</em>, the <em>Heidelberg Catechism</em>, the <em>Canons of Dordt</em>, and in Britain in the Westminster Assembly&#8217;s <em>Confession of Faith and Larger and Shorter Catechisms</em>, <em>Savoy Declaration</em>, <em>Second London Confession of Faith</em>), this did not mean they viewed the exegetical task as complete and, therefore, unnecessary, nor that there was no room for disagreement over the exegesis of individual texts. Muller comments:<strong></strong></p>
<p>the biblicism of the seventeenth-century orthodox must not be read as an era of dogmatizing exegesis devoid of careful textual analysis and devoid of any variety in interpretation among those of an orthodox confessional persuasion. Instead, the age ought to be viewed as the great age of Protestant linguistic study and Judaica, of the textual analysis that led to such monumental productions as the London Polyglot Bible. &#8230;the Protestant orthodoxy must be recognized as producing highly varied and diverse exegetical works and commentaries, ranging from text-critical essays, to textual annotations, theological annotations, linguistic commentaries based on the study of cognate languages and Judaica, doctrinal and homiletical commentaries, and, indeed, all manner of permutations and combinations of these several types of effort.[21]</p>
<p>Biblical exegesis, in fact, experienced a revival of sorts within the Reformed orthodox of the seventeenth century. Muller says:</p>
<p>Contrary to much of the &#8220;received wisdom&#8221; concerning the seventeenth century, the era of orthodoxy was a time of great exegetical, textual, and linguistic development in Protestantism&#8211;and, indeed, it was the orthodox exegetes who were responsible for the major monuments to biblical scholarship.[22]</p>
<p>Carl R. Trueman says, &#8220;&#8230;the seventeenth century witnessed a remarkable flourishing of linguistic and exegetical studies, driven by both the positive and the polemical exigencies of Protestantism&#8217;s commitment to scripture, in the original languages, as being the very Word &#8211; and words &#8211; of God.&#8221;[23] Trueman continues elsewhere:</p>
<p>A high view of the authority and integrity of the biblical text as God&#8217;s word written was [a] major factor in fuelling the development of careful attention both to the biblical languages and other cognate tongues, and to issues of textual history and criticism. The idea that the seventeenth-century Reformed were interested neither in careful exegesis nor in the literary and linguistic contexts of the Bible is simply untrue. Indeed, the linguistic and exegetical work of this century was far more elaborate than that which had marked the earlier Reformation. &#8230;the exegesis of the Reformed Orthodox is far from the dogmatically-driven Procusteanism[24] [<em>sic</em>] of popular mythology.[25]</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong><strong>A Redemptive-Historically Sensitive Method: </strong>Not only were the Reformed orthodox exegetically driven, their hermeneutic was a whole-Bible hermeneutic, evidenced in such concepts as their highly nuanced view of <em>sensus literalis</em> (literal sense), <em>analogia Scripturae </em>(analogy of Scripture), <em>analogia fidei </em>(analogy of faith), and <em>scopus Scripturae </em>(scope of Scripture).[26] It is of vital importance to understand the nuances involved with these concepts in order to properly understand the Reformed orthodox. We will explore these concepts in our next post.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The Renaissance: </strong>The Renaissance was a very complex humanist movement within Europe during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Two of the most important contributions it gave to the Reformation were a return to critical scholarship and philology. What the Renaissance gave to the Reformation, then, was an academic climate of questioning the <em>status quo</em> and seeking to arrive at conclusions based on primary documents. Pelikan comments:</p>
<p>The insistence of humanistic scholars on an understanding of the biblical text based on a fresh reading of the Hebrew and Greek originals &#8230;acted as a catalyst in the reconsideration of the doctrine of authority during the age of the Reformation.[1]</p>
<p>This insistence led to the study of Hebrew and Greek grammar, the study of Augustine, and most importantly, the study of Paul and the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>The Reformation:</strong> The Reformation was both a break with the negative elements of the past (especially the late medieval doctrine of ecclesiastical authority and the system of human merit theology) and a continuation of the discussion that had been taking place from the beginning. The Bible took center stage at the Reformation due, in part, to the influence of the Renaissance. With this came a renewed interest in Bible interpretation and historical theology, both from primary sources. The maxim <em>ad fontes</em>[2] produced intensified study in the original sources of the Christian tradition &#8211; the Bible first and foremost and, secondarily, the Apostolic Fathers, Patristics, and Augustine.</p>
<p>Neither Luther nor Calvin invented or discovered doctrines that had never been discussed before.[3] Luther&#8217;s discovery of the gospel of justification <em>sola fide</em> was, first and foremost, a biblical doctrine and a doctrine that all true Christians had believed from the beginning. It had been eclipsed by a system of human merit theology and sacerdotalism, but this does not mean that it never existed prior to Luther.</p>
<p>Calvin was no innovator himself. He built his system of theology on his understanding of Christian Scripture controlled by &#8220;the rule of faith.&#8221; He produced commentaries that are still influential in our day. The Reformers saw themselves as part of a long line of Christian interpreters, utilizing what they could from previous generations and repudiating, sometimes viciously, what they could not. Though Calvin sought to be a corrector of what he viewed as wrong with elements of the past, on the main, he assumed into his interpretive method the method handed down to him by his university professors &#8211; the scholastic method, in distinction from scholastic theology (more on this below).</p>
<p>Mention has been made of how some view the history of Christian interpretation in a mostly negative light. This assessment is, primarily, a post-Enlightenment phenomenon. David Steinmetz, in his book <em>Calvin in Context</em>, discusses Calvin&#8217;s interpretation of Isaiah 6:1ff. in the light of the history of interpretation prior to Calvin.[4] Prior to his discussion of the history of interpretation and Isaiah&#8217;s text, he notes this about F. W. Farrar.</p>
<p>In 1885 Frederic W. Farrar, chaplain to Queen Victoria and later Dean of Canterbury, delivered the Bampton Lecutres at Oxford on the subject of the history of interpretation. The book is a triumph of what the late Sir Herbert Butterfield of Cambridge called &#8220;Whig&#8221; historiography. Farrar admired about the past precisely those elements in it most like the present and regarded the present, indeed, as the inevitable culmination of all that was best in the past. The history of exegesis became for Farrar the history of &#8220;more or less untenable&#8221; conceptions of the Bible, &#8220;a history of false suppositions slowly and progressively corrected.&#8221; Not surprisingly, Farrar admired Antioch over Alexandria, Luther over Thomas Aquinas, Calvin over Luther, and the moderns [Enlightenment/post-Enlightenment interpreters] over all. Farrar catalogued with obvious delight every strained allegory, every factual inaccuracy, every philological howler committed by precritical exegetes in the name of biblical interpretation. While he admitted that ancient commentaries are full of practical instruction aimed at moral and spiritual edification and that much of this instruction is &#8220;of the highest intrinsic value,&#8221; he nevertheless warned that frequently such material &#8220;has but a slender connexion with the text on which it is founded.&#8221;[5]</p>
<p>Steinmetz goes on to show that Calvin&#8217;s exegesis of the Isaiah pericope is very similar to the history of interpretation on this text and even goes so far as to say, &#8220;While the precritical exegesis of Isaiah 6 is not an exegesis we can simply adopt, it is still not accurate to regard it as arbitrary and strained, of value only for its homiletical asides.&#8221;[6] Steinmetz interacts with Farrar after his discussion of Calvin on Isaiah 6 and the history of precritical interpretation on this text:</p>
<p>It is difficult to recognize the exegesis of Isaiah 6 we have just examined in the general description of the history of exegesis which Farrar offered. To be sure, it is true that the older consensus on the historical-critical setting of Isaiah 6 would find few supporters among modern commentators, but the older discussion of these questions does not seem arbitrary or strained, even by modern standards. The judgment of Christian commentators that Isaiah saw the glory of Christ was an exegetical conclusion forced on the commentators by the New Testament itself, though there was a tendency on the part of some commentators&#8211;including Calvin&#8211;to soften the hard edges of that exegesis.[7]</p>
<p>Farrar assumed critical, Enlightenment categories while interpreting the history of interpretation. This gave his history a slant or bias in a certain direction and explains his overly negative assessment of most of what took place prior to the modern era. Steinmetz concludes:</p>
<p>It is no answer to Farrar to point out that there is a good deal in ancient commentaries which is surprisingly modern even from a historical-critical or philological viewpoint, or to argue that the modern reader can find insight into the &#8220;literal&#8221; sense of the text in precritical commentaries. That is to admit his principle that precritical exegesis is good in the proportion that it anticipates or agrees with modern exegesis. Nor is it an answer to reply with a <em>tu quoque</em> [Latin, &#8220;thou also&#8221;] and to list the exegetical atrocities which have been committed from time to time in the name of the historical-critical method, though such a list is disquietingly easy to compile.</p>
<p>The principal value of precritical exegesis is that it is not modern exegesis; it is alien, strange, sometimes even, from our perspective, comic and fantastical. Precisely because it is strange, it provides a constant stimulus to interpreters, offering exegetical suggestions they would never think of or find in any modern book, forcing them again and again to a rereading and reevaluation of the text. But if they immerse themselves not only in the text but also in these alien approaches to the text, they may learn in time to see with eyes not their own sights they could scarcely have imagined and may learn to hear with ears not their own voices too soft for their own ears to detect.[8]</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/2011/05/wells-on-the-sabbath-chap-three-iii/">Tom Wells&#8217; book on the Sabbath: Chapter Three (III)</a></p>
<p><strong>Mark 2:27-28</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Wells discusses Mk. 2:27-28 (48-57). He claims, and rightly so, &#8220;There is no command in these verses&#8230;&#8221; (49). He continues, &#8220;&#8230;but an argument for Sabbath keeping has been drawn from each of them&#8221; (49). He states the argument this way:</p>
<p>The argument is twofold. First, if God at creation made the Sabbath a blessing for mankind, He certainly did not do so only to abolish it later. Second, when the Lord Jesus announces Himself as Lord of the Sabbath, it seems unlikely to suppose that He intended to exercise His Lordship over it by doing away with it. (49)</p>
<p>Dealing with this twofold argument, Wells assumes &#8220;that God commanded man to keep the Sabbath at the time of creation&#8221; (49), though he does not believe that to be the case. Discussing the first argument, he says:</p>
<p>The first argument implies the impossibility of God later abolishing anything that He made for mankind&#8217;s benefit at the creation. But is this sound reasoning? It may be true or it may be false, but it is certainly not obvious. Where is it written that if God once made something a blessing for mankind at large that He would never suspend it? (49)</p>
<p>He then gives examples of many things God has made for man&#8217;s benefit that he subsequently takes from man (i.e., the Garden of Eden, many wonderful fruits, extinct birds and animals, the benefits of family life for some believers in Christ, etc. [49-50]). What shall we say to this?</p>
<p>Wells asserts, without citing anyone, that &#8220;The first argument implies the impossibility of God later abolishing <em>anything</em> that He made for mankind&#8217;s benefit at the creation&#8221; (49; emphasis mine). Does the first argument imply this? Is this the way those Wells is arguing against state their position? I think the answer to both questions is a resounding, &#8220;No!&#8221; Do those who believe that God instituted some things for mankind&#8217;s good at creation also believe in &#8220;the impossibility of God later abolishing&#8221; those things? Again, Wells cites no one. In fact, he over-states his case. Claiming that God instituted some things for man&#8217;s good at creation does not <em>necessarily</em> imply the impossibility of God later abolishing those things. The Garden of Eden is a case in point, as Wells says.</p>
<p>The argument Wells set up (i.e., that &#8220;God at creation made the Sabbath a blessing for mankind&#8221;) needs additional elements to necessarily imply what he claims. Those who argue this would need to state that it is <em>impossible</em> for God to institute <em>anything</em> for man&#8217;s benefit at creation and then abolish it later. I don&#8217;t know of anyone who would argue this way, though someone who does may exist.</p>
<p>But there is another problem with Wells&#8217; response. The examples he uses of things instituted by God at creation for the benefit of man and later abolished are not identified as creation ordinances by those he is combating. Creation ordinances are not co-extensive with everything instituted by God for man in the Garden of Eden. Wells himself identifies what those who hold to creation ordinances identify as such. He says, &#8220;Often three are cited: marriage, labor and Sabbath&#8221; (26). In other words, for example, the Garden of Eden is not a creation ordinance in the minds of Wells&#8217; opponents. Even though it appears that Wells does not adhere to the doctrine of creation ordinances, he is disagreeing with those who do and should have seen the problem with arguing the way he did. In effect, he put words in the mouths of those he is critiquing and then shows those words to be impossible to square with Scripture. I found Wells&#8217; argument unconvincing and his method of argumentation, at this point, very sloppy.[1]</p>
<p>After extensive discussion, Wells denies that this verse teaches any sort of Sabbath perpetuity under the lordship of Christ as Son of Man. However, is it that simple? Let&#8217;s consider these verses in context in our next post.</p>
<p>[1] I am sure I have been guilty of the same thing.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Scholasticism.</strong> One of the ways that Medieval Scholasticism influenced the Reformation was through the universities attended by the Reformers. Our modern university system evolved during the late Middle Ages. Luther was well-schooled in the scholastic method and philosophy. His utter contempt for Aristotle was no doubt an over-reaction to his university training and the element of superstition in much of late medieval scholasticism.[1] McGrath comments: </p>
<p>Scholasticism is probably one of the most despised intellectual movements in human history. Thus the English word ‘dunce’ derives from the name of one of the greatest scholastic writers, Duns Scotus. Scholasticism is best regarded as the medieval movement, flourishing in the period 1200-1500, which placed great emphasis upon the rational justification of religious beliefs. It is the demonstration of the inherent rationality of Christian theology by an appeal to philosophy, and the demonstration of the complete harmony of that theology by the minute examination of the relationship of its various elements. Scholastic writings tended to be long and argumentative, frequently relying upon closely argued distinctions.[2]</p>
<p>Jaroslav Pelikan says, “The theological discussions of the period sometimes dealt with issues that did not directly involve the belief, teaching, and confession of the church.”[3] He goes on to list some of those theological discussions: whether a monk who died and then was resurrected would be obliged to return to the same religious order; whether or not the body of Christ after His resurrection had been able to digest food; whether or not Christ was alive when the lance pierced His side; the color of the Virgin Mary’s hair; the fact that Mary was conversant in the seven liberal arts, including astronomy, as well as with theology, as summarized in the <em>Sentences</em> of Peter Lombard.[4] Looking at it from this vantage-point, one can hardly blame Luther for his attitude toward Aristotelian scholastic theology, if in fact it can be said to be the catalyst of such speculation.</p>
<p>Though late medieval scholasticism had its faults, Calvin, for example, took the positive scholastic element of systemization and applied it in producing his <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion</em>.</p>
<hr size="1" />[1] See David C. Steinmetz<em>, Luther in Context </em>(Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1995), 56, where Steinmetz says, “No historian would seriously dispute the proposition that Luther’s break with scholastic theology was primarily a break with the theology of his own Occamist teachers.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/2011/05/wells-sabbath-chapter-three-ii/">Tom Wells&#8217; book on the Sabbath: Chapter Three (II)</a></p>
<p><strong>Matthew 12:1-14&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wells references Matt. 12:1-14 several times in chapter 3[1] but offers no exposition of the passage.[2] I will offer a brief exposition.</p>
<p>In Matt. 12, we are told that &#8220;Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. And His disciples were hungry, and began to pluck heads of grain and to eat&#8221; (Matt. 12:1). The Pharisees replied, &#8220;Look, Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!&#8221; (Matt. 12:2). Jesus then offers two examples from the OT; &#8220;&#8230;David&#8230; and those who were with him&#8221; (Matt. 12:3) and &#8220;the priests in the temple&#8221; (Matt. 12:5).[3] Concerning the priests, he says, &#8220;Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, and are blameless?&#8221; (Matt. 12:5). Whatever the priests were doing, the Pharisees&#8217; logic implied it was a violation of the Sabbath. Their logic taught that the priests, David, and Christ&#8217;s disciples were profaning the Sabbath. But Jesus says the priests &#8220;&#8230;are blameless&#8221; (Matt. 12:5). Then he quotes Hos. 6:6. He says, &#8220;But if you had known what this means, &#8216;<em>I desire mercy and not sacrifice</em>,&#8217; you would not have condemned the guiltless&#8221; (Matt. 12:7).[4] He pronounces his disciples &#8220;guiltless&#8221; by referencing two OT examples. In the next section of Matt. 12, the Pharisees ask, &#8220;Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?&#8221; (Matt. 12:10). Jesus concludes in v. 12, &#8220;Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221; This clearly teaches that healing on the Sabbath was lawful as was preserving the life of a sheep (vv. 10-12). His disciples ate because eating is necessary to sustain human life. All of these actions, according to Christ, were lawful on the Sabbath according to OT law. Jesus was correcting faulty thinking about the Sabbath by consulting prior revelation.</p>
<p>Someone might want to offer Matt. 12 as an example of Jesus abrogating the Sabbath (cf. Mk. 2:23-28 and Lk. 6:1-11).[5] They might claim that Jesus advocates Sabbath-breaking thereby proving that he was abolishing it. But does this text bear this out? Did Jesus, in fact, advocate Sabbath-breaking during his earthly ministry? We have just examined Matt. 12:1-14 and seen Christ justifying works of necessity and mercy and concluding in v. 12, &#8220;Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.&#8221; The &#8220;good&#8221; in the context of Matt. 12 involved not only what his disciples did and what he did, but what David and those with him and the old covenant priests did. The supposed violation of the Sabbath in this passage (and others) is actually an upholding of the Sabbath and in accordance with OT revelation. Jesus never advocated Sabbath-breaking during his earthly ministry. Jesus&#8217; teaching upholds existing Sabbath law.</p>
<p>Those who offer this objection may claim that when Jesus says, &#8220;But I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple&#8221; (v. 6) and &#8220;For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (v. 8), Jesus is claiming authority to abolish the Sabbath as he abolished the temple. In once sense, Christ did abolish the Sabbath. He abolished it in its various functions under the old covenant. And, in one sense, Christ abolished the temple. He did not, however, abolish the temple in all senses. His church is now God&#8217;s temple, where spiritual sacrifices are offered (Eph. 2:19-22; 1 Pt. 2:4-5). What does Jesus mean, when he says, &#8220;But I say to you that in this place there is One greater than the temple&#8221; (Mt. 12:6) and &#8220;For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath&#8221; (Matt. 12:8; cf. Mk. 2:28)? Fairbairn offers this explanation:</p>
<p>The Temple, He had said, has claims of service, which it was no proper desecration of the Sabbath, but the reverse, to satisfy; and &#8216;a greater than the Temple was there.&#8217; &#8216;The Temple yields to Christ, the Sabbath yields to the Temple, therefore the Sabbath yields to Christ&#8217;&#8211;so the sentiment is syllogistically expressed by Bengel; but yields, it must be observed, in both cases alike, only for the performance of works not antagonistic, but homogeneous, to its nature. &#8230; He is Lord of the Sabbath, and, as such, has a right to order everything concerning it, so as to make it, in the fullest sense, a day of blessing for man&#8211;a right, therefore, if He should see fit, to transfer its observance from the last day of the week to the first, that it might be associated with the consummation of His redemptive work, and to make it, in accordance with the impulsive life and energy thereby brought in, more than in the past, a day of active and hallowed employment for the good of men.[6]</p>
<p>Just as the temple yields to Christ and is transformed to fit the redemptive-historical circumstances brought in by his death and resurrection/exaltation, so the Sabbath yields to Christ and is transformed to fit the redemptive-historical circumstances brought in by his death and resurrection/exaltation. The new covenant has both a temple and a Sabbath. This connects Christ&#8217;s teaching on the temple and the Sabbath with subsequent revelation.</p>
<p>Instead of Matt. 12 proving that Christ abolished the Sabbath, it actually argues that he upheld it and sought to correct the Pharisees&#8217; faulty interpretation of Sabbath law. Fairbairn says, &#8220;Jesus grasped, as usual, the real spirit of the institution; for we are to remember, He is explaining the law of the Sabbath as it then stood, not superseding it by another.&#8221;[7] Christ upheld the Sabbath, cleared it of Pharisaic encumbrances, and set the stage for further revelation about it.</p>
<p>This objection assumes that the Sabbath in all senses was temporary, ceremonial law. Ceremonial laws are temporary laws for old covenant Israel and were a shadow of things to come (Col. 2:16-17). They were all abrogated by the coming of Christ and the inauguration of the new covenant (2 Cor. 3:7-18; Gal. 3-4; Eph. 2:14-16; Col. 2:16; and Heb. 8-10 [cf. esp. 8:6-7, 13; 9:9-10, 15; 10:1, 9, 15-18]). If the Sabbath is ceremonial law in all senses, then it has been abrogated. But the Sabbath is not ceremonial law in all senses, as we have seen (cf. Gen. 2:2-3; Ex. 20:8-11; Is. 56:2, 4, 6; and Mk. 2:27). And if Jesus considered it as ceremonial only, one would think he would treat it like he did other ceremonial laws. Beckwith and Stott comment:</p>
<p>But if Jesus regarded the sabbath as purely ceremonial and purely temporary, it is remarkable that he gives so much attention to it in his teaching, and also that in all he teaches about it he never mentions its temporary character. This is even more remarkable when one remembers that he emphasizes the temporary character of other parts of the Old Testament ceremonial&#8211;the laws of purity in Mark 7:14-23 and Luke 11:39-41, and the temple (with its sacrifices) in Mark 13:2 and John 4:21. By contrast, &#8230;he seems&#8230;to speak of the sabbath as one of the unchanging ordinances for all mankind.[8]</p>
<p>Jesus neither abrogated the Sabbath in all senses in his earthly ministry nor did he predict its soon demise. He upheld it and gave evidence that it would continue under his lordship as the Son of Man (Mk. 2:27-28).</p>
<p>We will look at Mk. 2:27-28 in our next post.</p>
<hr size="1">[1] I counted 10.</p>
<p>[2] In fact, the book contains little exegesis. Wells cites many texts and makes many observations; but he does little exegesis or exposition of passages. There was much proof-texting surrounded by observations that put the reader in an interpretive strait-jacket. I found his theological-interpretive method not very sound.</p>
<p>[3] Notice that Jesus is referring to previous revelation.</p>
<p>[4] Here is another reference to previous revelation.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The guys at Reformed Forum discuss the Creation Covenant with Dr. Roland S. Ward. I highly recommend Ward&#8217;s book  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Reformed-Theology-Creation-Covenant-Covenants/dp/095862416X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1305567192&amp;sr=1-1"><em>God &amp; Adam: Reformed Theology and the Creation Covenant</em>.</a> It is a wealth of information on this important issue.</p>
