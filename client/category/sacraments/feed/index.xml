										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Bob Gonzales, Academic Dean and a professor at <a title="Reformed Baptist Seminary" href="http://www.rbseminary.org/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Reformed Baptist Seminary</a> as well as an Adjunct Professor of Old Testament Studies here at MCTS has posted an article defending Believer Baptism (Credobaptism) against Infant Baptism (Paedobaptism) on his <a title="Dr. Bob Gonzales blog" href="http://drbobgonzales.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener">new blog</a>:&nbsp;&#8220;<a title="Why I'm Still a Baptist" href="http://drbobgonzales.com/2011/why-im-still-a-baptist/" target="_self" rel="noopener">Why I&#8217;m Still a Baptist</a>.&#8221;</p>
<p>(He is also teaching Old Testament Introduction I this fall at the Midwest Center. <a title="Old Testament Introduction I" href="http://www.mctsowensboro.org/event/2011-09-27-old-testament-introduction-i-with-dr-gonzales/" target="_self" rel="noopener">To learn more about his class, feel free to click here</a>.)</p>
<p>I highly recommend reading his article while studying John 1:12-13. I find his case both exegetical and persuasive. As he concludes:</p>
<blockquote><p>The question is one of <em>divinely bestowed legal warrant</em> (John 1:12). What the Credobaptist avers is that this demand for a credible profession of faith as the warrant for inclusion within God&#8217;s New Covenant family is not a substantial continuation of the state of affairs under the Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants with, of course, a few minor changes, like the switch from circumcision to baptism and from the Passover to the Lord&#8217;s Supper. It is, rather, a new state of affairs from a redemptive-historical standpoint. Hence, the church and her leadership are no longer warranted by God to include physical seed in the covenant by virtue of mere blood-ties to believing parents. To those who receive Christ and to those alone does God grant <em>de jure</em> the privilege of New Covenant member status.</p></blockquote>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is take from John Jefferson Davis, <em>Worship and the Reality of God: An Evangelical Theology of Real Presence</em>, 166-67.</p>
<p>The early church historian Robert Louis Wilken, in an interview in <em>Christian History</em>, stated forcefully that this sense of distinctiveness from the surrounding culture, exemplified and celebrated in the Eucharist [Davis just argued that &#8220;Unbelievers were welcome during the liturgy of the word, but dismissed at the time of the Eucharist.&#8221;], was in fact one secret of its spiritual strength. Rather than having as its primary focus impact on the culture, the early church, he said, &#8220;was itself a culture and created a new Christian culture.&#8221; In answer to the question, &#8220;Did the early church strive to be &#8216;user-friendly&#8217;?&#8221; Wilken responded as follows:</p>
<p>Not at all &#8211; in fact, just the opposite. One thing that made early Christian community strong was its stress on ritual. There was something unique about Christian liturgy, especially the Eucharist&#8230;.Pagans entered a wholly different world than they were used to. Furthermore, it was difficult to join the early church&#8230;.I think seeker-sensitive churches use a completely wrong strategy. A person who comes into a Christian church for the first time <em>should</em> feel out of place. He should feel this community engages in practices so important they take time to learn. The best thing we can do for &#8220;seekers&#8221; is to create an environment where newcomers feel they are missing something vital, that one has to be included into this&#8230;.Few people grasp this today. But the early church grasped it very well.</p>
<p>Some readers may think that Wilken has overstated his case, but nonetheless concede that his point is well taken, that is, that the church must be truly distinctive to have a lasting spiritual impact on the world.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Our Confessional and Catechetical Formulation of the Lord’s Supper as Means of Grace</strong></p>
<p><strong>Introduction:</strong> The confessional formulation of the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper as means of grace is not based on one biblical text, but upon a complex of texts and doctrines that are all interrelated. The confessional formulation is based on at least the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1) the accounts in the Gospels of the institution of the Lord’s Supper by Christ prior to his exaltation;</li>
<li>2) the words of the apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 10 and 11, which are post-ascension, inspired, explanatory applications of the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper as instituted by Christ during his humiliation;</li>
<li>3) the grace of faith and how it grows and develops more and more into Christ-likeness through the use of means;</li>
<li>4) union with Christ, or what Gaffin calls existential union, effected by faith and brought to souls by the Holy Spirit;</li>
<li>5) the ministry of the Holy Spirit in relation to the exalted Redeemer in bringing mediatorial, redemptive benefits to the souls of believers.</li>
</ul>
<p> </p>
<p>We will look briefly at our Confession (1677/89) and then the Baptist Catechism of 1693. I view the Catechism as a practical mechanism through which the doctrine of the Confession was taught. Theological formulation came first (the Confession) and then practical reflection (the Catechism).</p>
<p><strong>2</strong><sup><strong>nd</strong></sup><strong> LCF (1677/89)</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. 30:1</strong> The supper of the Lord Jesus was instituted by him the same night wherein he was betrayed, to be observed in his churches to the end of the world, for the perpetual remembrance, and shewing forth the sacrifice in his death, confirmation of the faith of believers in all the benefits thereof, their spiritual nourishment and growth in him, their further engagement in, and to all duties which they owe to him; and to be a bond and pledge of their communion with him, and with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Three observations:</strong></p>
<p>1)      The supper confirms the faith of believers in the benefits of Christ’s death. The Supper tells everyone who has faith in Christ, “All that He is for sinners, He is for you!”</p>
<p>2)      The supper is a means through which spiritual nourishment and growth in Christ occurs. This is the language of means of grace. Something happens during the Supper that alters our souls for the better. “…spiritual nourishment and growth in him…”</p>
<p>3)      The supper is a bond and pledge of communion with Christ. It is God’s bond and God’s pledge to us.</p>
<p><strong>b. 30:7</strong> Worthy receivers, outwardly partaking of the visible elements in this ordinance, do then also inwardly by faith, really and indeed, yet not carnally and corporally, but spiritually receive, and feed upon Christ crucified, and all the benefits of his death; the body and blood of Christ being then not corporally or carnally, but spiritually present to the faith of believers in that ordinance, as the elements themselves are to their outward senses.</p>
<p><strong>Two observations:</strong></p>
<p>1)      Worthy receivers spiritually receive and feed upon Christ and the benefits of His death in the Supper. There is some sort of spiritual transaction that takes place during the Supper.</p>
<p>2)      The body and blood of Christ are spiritually present to the faith of believers in the supper. Here I take “body and blood” as the benefits coming to us as a result of Christ’s death for us. <strong>Excursus</strong>: <strong>Q:</strong> How do the benefits of Christ’s death come to us? <strong>A:</strong> The benefits of Christ’s death come to us through the human instrumentality of faith in Christ (union with Christ) and through the divine instrumentality of the ministry of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p><strong>The Baptist Catechism (1693)</strong></p>
<p><strong>a. Q.94.</strong> What are the outward means, by which Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> The outward and ordinary means, by which Christ communicates to us the benefits of redemption, are his ordinances, especially the Word of God, baptism, the Lord’s Supper, and prayer; all which means are made effectual to the elect for salvation.</p>
<p><strong>Two observations:</strong></p>
<p>1)      The Lord’s Supper is identified as an outward and ordinary means of grace.</p>
<p>2)      Christ <em>communicates</em> the benefits of redemption during the Lord’s Supper. The grace that is communicated during the Lord’s Supper is purchased grace, redemptive grace, grace from the exalted Mediator to the souls of men. This means that in the Supper we receive something from Christ. There’s communion going on, sharing going on between Christ and His people during the Supper.</p>
<p><strong>b. Q. 97.</strong> How do baptism and the Lord’s Supper become effectual means of salvation?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Baptism and the Lord’s Supper become effectual means of salvation, not for any virtue in them, or in him that does administer them, but only by the blessing of Christ, and the working of the Spirit in those that by faith receive them.</p>
<p><strong>Two observations:</strong></p>
<p>1)      The sacraments do not work <em>ex opera operato</em>.</p>
<p>2)      Christ blesses them and the Holy Spirit works grace into the souls of believers.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Who said this? &#8220;&#8230;the central reality in a New Testament understanding of the Lord&#8217;s Supper is that the risen Christ, alive and present in the Spirit, continues to meet his people in joyful fellowship at the table. Jesus Christ is really present in the celebration of the Lord&#8217;s Supper, not on the table, circumscribed by the elements, but at the table, as the true minister and celebrant, continuing to enjoy fellowship with his disciples as he did during his earthly ministry.&#8221;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://mp3.sharpens.org/20101204ISI.mp3">Chris Arnzen interviews John Jefferson Davis</a> about his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Worship-Reality-God-Evangelical-Theology/dp/0830838848/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1291928579&amp;sr=8-1"><em>Worship and the Reality of God: An Evangelical Theology of Real Presence.</em></a> I have not read the book (but plan to [just ordered a reveiw copy from IVP]) and will surely not agree with everything Davis says. However, from what I can tell, this books looks very interesting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can read DeYoung&#8217;s post on Luke 4:16-21  <strong><a href="http://thegospelcoalition.org/blogs/kevindeyoung/2010/07/20/seven-passages-on-social-justice-7/">here</a></strong>. Below is one of his responses to numerous comments:</p>
<p>Daren, those are excellent questions, and a I certainly don’t want to discourage brothers and sisters sacrificing to meet the needs of those around the world. My sense is that we should speak less about what we must do and more in terms of what we can do. That is, I’d like to see the church inspire its members by saying “Here are opportunities to love” rather than putting a burden on folks that says, “This is a matter of justice. We are responsible to fix this.” I think it’s also important to see the difference between the church’s mission (to make disciples) and the calling God may have on our lives as individuals (politics, medicine, agriculture, etc.). A doctor doesn’t have to evangelize his patients to justify being a doctor. But on the other hand, the mission of the church is not to build hospitals. May God bless you as serve.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="text-align: center;">
<p>Below is a portion of chapter one of Gary Crampton&#8217;s new book, From Paedobaptism to Credobaptism. You can purchase the book for $14.30 at <a href="http://www.rbap.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RBAP</a>.</p>
<p>A Problem with the Doctrine of Infant Baptism in the Westminster Standards</p>
<p>The present writer is in agreement with B. B. Warfield that the Westminster Standards, consisting of the Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, &#8220;are the richest and most precise and best guarded statement ever penned of all that enters into evangelical religion, and of all that must be safeguarded if evangelical religion is to persist in the world.&#8221;[1] Then too, Richard Baxter was correct, when he stated, &#8220;As far as I am able to judge, the Christian world, since the days of the apostles, had never a synod more excellent than this [the Westminster Assembly].&#8221;[2]</p>
<p>As a minister of the gospel, I believe that the Westminster Standards provide the finest summary of the system of doctrine taught in Holy Scripture.[3] In this sense, the Standards are considered to be a subordinate standard to the inspired, infallible, inerrant Word of God. The Bible alone has a systematic monopoly on truth.</p>
<p>The Standards, as with all confessions and creeds, must be evaluated in light of Scripture. One must adhere to the Berean principle of Acts 17:11, where we are enjoined to &#8220;search the Scriptures daily to find out whether these things be true.&#8221; As stated in the Westminster Confession (31:4) and as valuable as confessions and creeds are (and they are very valuable), the fact is that &#8220;all synods or councils, since the apostles&#8217; times, whether general or particular, may err; and many have erred.&#8221; Therefore, says the Confession (1:10), &#8220;The Supreme Judge, by which all controversies of religion are to be determined, and all decrees of councils, opinions of ancient writers, doctrines of men, and private spirits, are to be examined, and in whose sentence we are to rest, can be no other but the Holy Spirit speaking in the Scripture.&#8221; As taught in the Larger Catechism (Q. 3), &#8220;The Holy Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the Word of God, the only rule of faith and obedience.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is while engaged in a thorough study of the two New Testament sacraments, baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper, that I encountered a problem with the doctrine of infant baptism. The problem is three-fold: first, there are no examples of infant baptism in the Bible; second, baptism and the Lord&#8217;s Supper go together; and third, there are multiple differences among paedobaptists as to why infants should be baptized.</p>
<p>[1] Benjamin B. Warfield, Selected Shorter Writings, edited by John E. Meeter (Phillipsburg, NJ: Presbyterian and Reformed, 1973), II:660.</p>
<p>[2] Cited on the back cover of Westminster Confession of Faith (Glasgow: Free Presbyterian Publications, 1994). All citations from the Westminster Standards, comprised of the Westminster Confession of Faith and the Larger and Shorter Catechisms, are from this publication. The English has been modernized. Note is made that when this author says that he is in agreement with what Warfield and Baxter have said about the Westminster Standards, the same could be said (with certain nuances here and there) about the Congregational Savoy Declaration (1658) and the London Baptist Confession of 1689, because some 90% of the doctrines taught by these three confessions are in agreement with one another. See Errol Hulse, The Testimony of Baptism (Sussex: Carey Publications, 1982), 57.</p>
<p>[3] Again, a similar statement could be made (with certain nuances) with regard to the Savoy Declaration and the London Baptist Confession of 1689.</p>
