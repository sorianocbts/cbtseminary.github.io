										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is take from John Jefferson Davis, <em>Worship and the Reality of God: An Evangelical Theology of Real Presence</em>, 166-67.</p>
<p>The early church historian Robert Louis Wilken, in an interview in <em>Christian History</em>, stated forcefully that this sense of distinctiveness from the surrounding culture, exemplified and celebrated in the Eucharist [Davis just argued that &#8220;Unbelievers were welcome during the liturgy of the word, but dismissed at the time of the Eucharist.&#8221;], was in fact one secret of its spiritual strength. Rather than having as its primary focus impact on the culture, the early church, he said, &#8220;was itself a culture and created a new Christian culture.&#8221; In answer to the question, &#8220;Did the early church strive to be &#8216;user-friendly&#8217;?&#8221; Wilken responded as follows:</p>
<p>Not at all &#8211; in fact, just the opposite. One thing that made early Christian community strong was its stress on ritual. There was something unique about Christian liturgy, especially the Eucharist&#8230;.Pagans entered a wholly different world than they were used to. Furthermore, it was difficult to join the early church&#8230;.I think seeker-sensitive churches use a completely wrong strategy. A person who comes into a Christian church for the first time <em>should</em> feel out of place. He should feel this community engages in practices so important they take time to learn. The best thing we can do for &#8220;seekers&#8221; is to create an environment where newcomers feel they are missing something vital, that one has to be included into this&#8230;.Few people grasp this today. But the early church grasped it very well.</p>
<p>Some readers may think that Wilken has overstated his case, but nonetheless concede that his point is well taken, that is, that the church must be truly distinctive to have a lasting spiritual impact on the world.</p>

<p>Well, it is hard to believe that we have reached our final week together.  Mike has really taken us on a whirlwind tour of his life as a church planter (or would it be more accurate to call him a church restorer?).  In any case, Mike doesn&#8217;t want to end his book without giving some encouragement and comfort to those who seek to plant Christ-centered churches.  He recognizes how difficult it is and how easily it can be to get discouraged.  Compound this challenge with the constant pressure to &#8220;produce results,&#8221; and it can quickly overwhelm the best of us.</p>
<p>So, in his last chapter, he deals with the question of numbers and success in ministry head-on.  Mike writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Here is my solution, and in many ways the main point I want to make with this book: I want to redefine <em>extraordinary</em>&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8220;When you plant a church, you are signing on to God&#8217;s plan for God&#8217;s purposes.  It&#8217;s up to you to be faithful as you depend on God&#8217;s grace to carry out your appointed task.  God will use your labors to do his will.  It could be that your congregation is meant to be a larger piece of the overall picture, or it could be that it&#8217;s meant to be a smaller piece.  Either way, don&#8217;t forget the privilege it is to be even a &#8216;small&#8217; part of God&#8217;s marvelous plan.  It&#8217;s an extraordinary calling&#8221; (110-111).</p>
<p>What an obvious truth!  And yet how easy it can be to get sucked into the comparison game.  How many attended worship last Sunday?  What are we going to do now that one of our large families has started attending another church?  Why isn&#8217;t God blessing my ministry like he is ___________? (full in the blank)</p>
<p>I thank Mike for how he ends his book.  It is a nice reminder for me as I seek to faithfully serve my Savior.  I pray that I will remain faithful to Christ and focused on His glory in my service to Him!</p>
<p>Do you have any final thoughts?</p>

<p>Mike&#8217;s church had grown steadily over the last year and a half, and he and his wife were stressed.  Upon meeting with one of his wise pastor friends named Bob, he was told &#8220;you are doing everything totally wrong.&#8221;  While this was a hard pill to swallow, he knew it was true.  Both he and his wife were exhausted.  They were largely focusing on helping new people assimilate into the congregation.  But as his experienced friend told him, Mike should have spent more time training new leaders in the church.</p>
<p>Recognizing the leadership gap at Guilford, Mike began thinking about what this kind of man in their church should look like.  His list of qualities basically summarized the biblical qualifications of an elder, so with this in mind he began to plan out how to make this dream a reality.  By borrowing Bob&#8217;s program, he opened up a time of training to interested men at the church.</p>
<p>And you know what?  He had 15 guys at their first meeting.  His commitment to them began paying off, and he wound up with a group of guys who were maturing and could be relied upon.  As a result, when the church decided to identify new elders and small-group leaders, they already had a group of trained men equipped and ready to serve.</p>
<p>n my mind, this chapter makes a basic yet important point to remember if and when the Lord blesses me with a ministry opportunity.  Like Moses, we can run ourselves ragged by trying to do too much.  And Bob, like Jethro, gives wise advice in having other qualified men to share the load.</p>
<p>As Mike reminds us, we must not decide who those leaders will be by the standards of the world.  He must be a real man:</p>
<p>&#8220;Being a real man means being responsible, dependable, humble, and strong.  It means pouring yourself out for your wife and kids.  It means walking closely with Christ and taking care of people in need&#8221; (102).</p>
<p>May the Lord give me the strength to be this kind of a man!</p>

<p>Mike begins by suggesting that this chapter will be the most helpful  one in the book. He is right, or at least it has been for me.  Why is it  so important?  He explains upfront:</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll cut to the chase: planting a church can be brutal on your  marriage.  It almost wrecked mine.  No, scratch that.  My sin almost  wrecked our marriage.  Church planting was simply the arena in which the  whole thing played out&#8221; (85).</p>
<p>So, this chapter explains how his own serious marriage problems  developed.  Both he and Karen became extremely busy in keeping Guilford  alive.  Then the fights started&#8212;constantly, all the time for months.</p>
<p>Then it got worse.  They had their third child, experiencing the  additional stress of having three under the age of four.  And as if this  was not enough, his wife was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  Their  marriage troubles and fights continued to increase through these trials.</p>
<p>Mike doesn&#8217;t let himself off the hook.  In fact, he diagnoses his  sin: fear of man.  He cared too much about success, leading to too much  work for him and his wife.  He also didn&#8217;t protect Karen from the  expectations of the congregation (Preacher&#8217;s Wife perfectionism).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, God does not give up on us!  Things began to change as  Mike was reading James 4&#8212;he realized that he needed more grace.  They  began to open up their struggles and problems to others.  Then they met a  couple involved with Sovereign Grace Ministries who helped them tackle  their marriage problems in light of the gospel.  Mike and Karen began to  forgive each other and change, praise God!</p>
<p>As you can tell, I was deeply convicted and challenged by this  chapter.  While I have not been involved in church planting, I too can  see my susceptibility to the fear of man.  As I read these words, I  asked myself if I am prepared to serve in ministry:</p>
<p>&#8220;Fear of man is one of the worst forms of pride.  And pastoring a  tiny, fledgling church will give you unending opportunities to fear  men&#8230;.  Even though I knew better, I cared too much about the  appearance of success.  I didn&#8217;t just want the church to do well&#8212;I  wanted it to do well in ways that were obvious to others&#8230;.  As a  result, I took too much onto my plate and put too much onto Karen&#8217;s&#8230;.   I didn&#8217;t want the service to fail in the eyes of other people, but I  didn&#8217;t care about failing at home&#8221; (89-90).</p>
<p>Now here is a man with all of his theological &#8220;ducks in a row.&#8221;  He  believes in the sovereignty of God and that only Christ can build his  church.  However, his practice did not line up with his beliefs.  In the  day-to-day life of the church, he depended on himself for the church&#8217;s  success.  Would I be any different?  I do not want to answer too  quickly.  I pray that God will richly bless my marriage with his grace,  regardless of whatever ministry he calls me to.</p>
<p>What did you think of this week&#8217;s reading?  Have you been challenged?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we continue our chapter-by-chapter blog discussion of the book Church Planting is For Wimps. For those of you who may have just been browsing so far, it is not too late to join in! Simply pick up a copy of the book and start reading. If you have missed the previous posts, please read my thoughts on chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, and chapter 4.</p>
<p>Before Mike was called as Pastor of Guilford Fellowship, the church asked a consultant to assess their situation and give recommendations. Given the changing demographics of those living around the church, one option was to disband and allow a Spanish-speaking church plant to have the church building. While they didn&#8217;t go in this direction, as Mike points out, God will always get his way. And his way at Guilford is to love and reach the Spanish-speaking community that surrounded them.</p>
<p>So how did it happen? Mike quickly saw the need for a Spanish ministry and began to pray. God answered by having a married couple who are native Spanish speakers join their church. This man became quite a gifted evangelist and teacher, and he began to lead more and more in an evangelistic Bible study. As the Lord continued to bless this group, Guilford recognized the need for them to have their own local congregation. God once again answered their prayers by providing an experienced pastor from El Salvador.</p>
<p>Not to say that this outreach has been easy for Mike and the church. Most of the Spanish community is nice and law-abiding. But there are also gangs, graffiti, and other challenges. Nevertheless, the church was willing to &#8220;step up to the plate&#8221; and begin preaching to gang members, illegal immigrants, prostitutes, and others. This has led to Mike&#8217;s insistence of reaching out to the poor and the destitute, to the outcasts and the downtrodden.</p>
<p>Their Spanish ministry has also allowed them to show the love of Christ to the community, which has become heavily alienated between their neighborhood&#8217;s English-speaking and Spanish-speaking populations. Guilford continues to support and maintain good relations with the Spanish church, striving to communicate and live out the power of the gospel.</p>
<p>As Mike concludes:</p>
<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t need to make a ton of plans and strategies for how we are going to reach the world. God is more passionate about spreading his gospel than we are. We only need to be passionate about following his lead and trusting him for his provision&#8221; (84).</p>
<p>This truth is so simple, but so often overlooked. I have seen churches that plan, program, and strategize to death. But what we need most is to live our lives more and more in light of the gospel.</p>
<p>I was most challenged when Mike wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;The Bible teaches that the gospel will find its warmest welcome among the poor and destitute, the outcasts and the downtrodden. The riches of the world powerfully tempt us to trust in them for our well-being&#8230;. So if you are planning on planting a church, consider swinging at the low-hanging fruit, as one of my seminary professors put it. Think about ways that your church can reach out to those whose station in life might make them more aware of their need for Christ. Consider making your housing choices accordingly, even if it means living in conditions that might not excite your mother-in-law&#8221; (80-81).</p>
<p>Am I willing to do this? Even when I have a family with several young children? May the Lord grant me the strength to do his will!</p>
<p>But now it is your turn. Thoughts?</p>

For those of you who may have just been browsing so far, it is not too late to join in! Simply pick up a copy of the book and start reading. If you have missed the previous posts, please read my thoughts on chapter 1, chapter 2, and chapter 3.</p>
<p>Mike is now pastor of Guilford Fellowship and faithfully preaching God&#8217;s Word. He has begun to steadily work toward revitalizing this church. But he begins to recognize a new and pressing challenge&#8211;membership. He finds more and more people in the local community who consider themselves members of Guilford, but who have not been involved in any way for years. And then there are those who have left the church since he became pastor. None of them had resigned their membership, and most never even bothered to tell him that they were leaving. And if this was not enough, he couldn&#8217;t even find a membership list to know who were actually members of the church.</p>
<p>What could he do? He led the church to require that all who wanted to remain members must sign the church covenant. After giving this opportunity to any who considered themselves members, Only those in regular attendance were willing to make this commitment. They took the covenants that they had received and created a church membership list.</p>
<p>Then Mike did something that is against everything you will ever read about in church planting and church growth materials. He ditched their mission and vision statements! Can you believe it? But I appreciate his reasoning:</p>
<p>&#8220;Look, if you don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re supposed to be doing as a church planter, if you need to write out a statement in order to remember that your church is supposed to evangelize the lost and help Christians grow in Christ, friend, you shouldn&#8217;t be a church planter. How about casting vision the way Protestants have cast vision for the past five hundred years! Teach God&#8217;s Word! Explain it to God&#8217;s people, and tell them God&#8217;s mission and vision and values and purpose and strategy for their life. Don&#8217;t refer them back to some mantra that you make sure everyone in the congregation has memorized. Teach them what the Bible says about what it means to be a faithful Christian and a faithful church&#8221; (62-63).</p>
<p>So, in many ways, he brings the church to the point where they have a clean slate. What is the next step? Addressing the church&#8217;s statement of faith. Not that it was all that bad, but it was cobbled together from their denomination&#8217;s statement and a local seminary&#8217;s statement. Unfortunately, it majored on the minors in some doctrinal areas, and Mike wanted to root their church more firmly in its historical roots. So the church decided to adopt the New Hampshire Confession of Faith. I know, I know, it is not our beloved 1689 London Baptist Confession of Faith or even its American counterpart, the Philadelphia Confession of Faith. But at least the pastor led his church to an understanding of the need to have a clear confession, and he includes several reasons why church plants and existing churches should be confessional.</p>
<p>Then Mike tackles the church&#8217;s constitution and by-laws. Sure this may sound boring and involve many things that many of us could care less about, but we all should care about the nature and structure of the church and its leadership. Using Capitol Hill Baptist Church as their starting point, the committee made a few changes to CHBC&#8217;s constitution and presented it to the congregation. After a few months of conversation, they voted to adopt it.</p>
<p>One reason why Mike was so intent on revising Guilford&#8217;s constitution was to move to a plural eldership in the church&#8217;s leadership. He writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;I wanted elders who would function as elders by shepherding and teaching the congregation; and I wanted deacons who would function as deacons by serving the congregation and making sure needs are met&#8230;. Establishing a plural eldership doesn&#8217;t mean neglecting other important parts of the Christian mission; it means raising up more men to lead in the very work of Christian mission&#8221; (68-69).</p>
<p>Amen! Like Mike, I see far too many church planters, pastors, and other church leaders today who do not understand the importance of having a plurality of elders. It is the biblical expectation and necessary for the health of the church. This is not a minor issue for those of us who like to debate ecclesiology. It is how God has revealed His churches to be led. And read how Mike explains the benefits he quickly experienced:</p>
<p>&#8220;Suddenly I had a recognized group of men (older men, wiser men) with whom I could deliberate about the affairs of the church. The burden of making decisions, planning strategies, and shepherding the flock was now spread across three sets of shoulders&#8221; (70).</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t want it to be any other way.</p>
<p>But now you are up. What are your thoughts?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we continue our chapter-by-chapter blog discussion of the book Church Planting is For Wimps. For those of you who may have just been browsing so far, it is not too late to join in! Simply pick up a copy of the book and start reading. If you have missed the previous posts, please read my thoughts on chapter 1 and chapter 2.</p>
<p>In our latest reading, Mike moves to Washington DC in preparation for revitalizing a church in the area. On his first day at CHBC, someone tells him of a struggling church in Sterling, Virginia. Open to the possibility that this church is an answer to prayer, Mike contacts Guilford Fellowship for an opportunity to preach.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just say that this visit did not go very well. Everything was wrong, from the location and grounds to the carpet and plumbing. The worship service was small, unorganized, and included people not actually there to worship God. Mike even mentions two teenagers publically displaying affection in the back pew throughout the service, including his sermon! Everyone from CHBC left thinking that this church was too far gone. Everyone except Mike&#8217;s wife.</p>
<p>His wife&#8217;s intuition ultimately proved correct. CHBC realized that the area&#8217;s economic and real estate environment meant this church was their best option. And the church came to recognize Mike as their best pastoral candidate. He became their pastor on June 1, 2005.</p>
<p>Given all of the immediate problems, challenges, and issues of Guilford Fellowship, what did Mike believe their greatest need was?</p>
<p>&#8220;Let me suggest an answer that may not be immediately apparent: the one thing that Guilford Fellowship needed most from its new pastor was to have God&#8217;s Word preached in a clear, systematic, and compelling way&#8221; (47).</p>
<p>Did he replace toilets, put down new floors, pull weeds, and spread gravel? Sure. But he would only complete this work after taking care of his primary responsibility to preach and teach God&#8217;s Word. Thus, Mike concludes his chapter with three enemies which can keep church planters and pastors from keeping the Word of God central.</p>
<p>I am so thankful and encouraged to read about Mike&#8217;s firm commitment to the centrality of Scripture. It is so easy to begin thinking about all that we need to do so that our church will be successful, slowly trusting in ourselves. But God&#8217;s way is simple: preach the Word; let Christ build His kingdom. As Mike says:</p>
<p>&#8220;You preach and people get saved to God&#8217;s glory, or their so-called &#8216;wisdom&#8217; is confounded and you look like a moron, also to God&#8217;s glory&#8221; (51).</p>
<p>Am I willing to look like a moron? Am I willing to appear foolish for my Savior? Am I prepared to faithfully preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles (1 Corinthians 1:23)? I appreciate Mike providing three enemies of Word centered ministry, recognizing that I must assess my heart in light of them.</p>
<p>What about you?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we continue our chapter-by-chapter blog discussion of the book Church Planting is For Wimps.  For those of you who may have just been browsing so far, it is not too late to join in!  Simply pick up a copy of the book and start reading.  And if you missed last week’s post, please read it first.</p>
<p>Now we come to Chapter 2.  After talking about his decision to plant a church with Mark Dever and Capitol Hill Baptist Church in the last chapter, he moves on to discuss how they went about determining their approach to this new work.  Mike would begin by spending a couple of years on staff at CHBC, working through the process of their church plant.  This included Mike meeting with members who may be interested in church planting, meeting with other church planters and pastors in the area where they were going to plant, and building credibility with the congregation by becoming more involved in the church’s public teaching and preaching.</p>
<p>They ultimately decided to start a gospel work about forty-five minutes outside Washington DC (where CHBC is located).  But this still left them with one major question.  Mike explains:</p>
<p>&#8220;The last thing to determine was whether we would plant an altogether new church or have the planting team join an existing church in order to revitalize it.  Church planting (starting a congregation from scratch) and church revitalizing (reviving the ministry of an almost dead church) share the same goal: raising up a faithful gospel witness where none exists.  Both have a unique opportunity to grow by attracting people not currently attending a church and to bring fresh energy to the proclamation of the gospel in a particular community&#8221; (30-31).</p>
<p>While understanding the validity and need of church planting, they eventually decided on church revitalization.  For the rest of the chapter, Mike explains the advantages and disadvantages of either choice.  Next up?  They had to find a church that was a good candidate for revitalization.</p>
<p>I admit that like Mike, I am personally attracted to church revitalization.  Maybe it is because I have noticed a strong interest in church planting among my fellow seminary graduates while the idea of church revitalization seems to be neglected.  Maybe it is because I have met a lot of dear saints in small churches who have been praying for a revival in their church and community.  Maybe it is because I would love to see God working through the challenge of revitalization for His glory.  Regardless, I appreciate it when Mike remarks:</p>
<p>&#8220;That’s why a number of my friends have joked from time to time that church planting is for wimps.  There are challenges to setting up a new general store in a dusty cowboy town when none exists, to be sure.  But the sheriff who has to ride in and clear out a town’s trash before building starts—he’s the real man&#8221; (34).</p>
<p>I don’t see myself as a sheriff (nor am I a fan of Westerns!).  And I have no idea what God has in store for my future ministry.  But I agree with Mike when he writes:</p>
<p>&#8220;Is church planting for wimps?  Well, planting and revitalizing take different kinds of courage, and God appoints a particular task for ever y man.  Go where God guides you. . . .  I believe revitalizing may be more difficult at the outset, but I also believe that it offers all the rewards of planting—a new gospel witness—and more: it removes a bad witness in the neighborhood, it encourages the saints in the dead church, and it puts their material resources to work for the kingdom&#8221; (36-37).</p>
