					<description><![CDATA[Mr. Snyder,

Thank you for your thoughtful comment. Interestingly enough, several non-dispensational commentators also conclude that the difference between ÏƒÎ±Î²Î²Î±Ï„Î¹ÏƒÎ¼ÏŒÏ‚ and ÎºÎ±Ï„Î¬Ï€Î±Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚ is one of nuance. Essentially, they understand ÎºÎ±Ï„Î¬Ï€Î±Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Ï‚ to represent the concept of a place for rest and ÏƒÎ±Î²Î²Î±Ï„Î¹ÏƒÎ¼ÏŒÏ‚ to represent the nature of that rest. Given the fact that the these two terms are in series that is delineated by the verb á¼€Ï€Î¿Î»Îµá½·Ï€ÎµÏ„Î±Î¹, it is very hard to understand why anyone would have to resort to mere etymology without taking into consideration the whole context.

For some good non-dispensational commentary on this text, see O&#039;Brien in the Pillar NT Commentary series, Walter Kaiser&#039;s article &quot;The Promise Theme and Theology of Rest,&quot; and Peter Enns&#039; article &quot;Creation and Re-Creation.&quot; Another good resource would be Frank Theilman&#039;s &quot;Theology of the New Testament.&quot; To be fair, none of these works are definitive per se, but I believe they move us past the word-study fallacy (See Carson&#039;s &quot;Exegetical Fallacies&quot;) to genuine exegesis of the text.

Furthermore, I can appreciate the concern about dispensationalism, but I sure hope that we don&#039;t write off the sound exegetical methods of these men just because of there presuppositions that we (of course) do not have :)

Have a blessed one!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[To clarify, most commentators would disagree that Hebrews 4 teaches the perpetual existence of a &quot;sabbath day&quot; the way that sabbatarians do. As for Colossians 2, it appears as though Paul would probably have to disagree as well since he calls the Sabbath a &quot;shadow&quot; of which He identifies &quot;Christ&quot; as the substance. So if Christ has come and inaugurated the &quot;already&quot; of the &quot;not yet&quot; rest, then I find it hard to imagine that the shadow maintains the same significance once the substance is revealed. Doubtless you will disagree, but the brevity of my comment indicates that I am not interested in persuasion, but rather, mere statement.

On another front though, I am thankful for many of the resources that are available here. May the Lord continue to bless your ministry.]]></description>
