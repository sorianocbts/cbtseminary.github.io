					<description><![CDATA[Greetings Mr. Waldron,

I am pleased that someone else is reviewing this growing movement. I have studied it for over 2 years and think we can compliment each others approach.

I do not wish to &quot;highjack&quot; your blog, but if you are willing I can give links to the following but people can google:

1. What Doug Phillips believes &quot;Christian homeschooling 
conference: who is Doug Phillips?&quot; (examiner.com)
2. &quot;A Weed in the Church: a Review&quot; (ChristianNurture.blogspot.com)
3. &quot;What is a Family Integrated Church?&quot; (weswhite.net)
4. &quot;Uniting Church and Family&quot; (weswhite.net)

thank you,
Pastor Shawn Mathis]]></description>
