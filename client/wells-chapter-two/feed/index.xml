					<description><![CDATA[The Sabbath of Exodus 20:11 refers both to God’s Sabbath and man’s. John Frame says:

It is important to ask, what Sabbath does Ex. 20:11 refer to? Does “Sabbath” here refer to God’s rest after creating the world, or to man’s own Sabbath rest? The answer has to be, both. The first sentence of Ex. 20:11 refers to God’s own rest. But “Sabbath” in the second sentence must refer to the same Sabbath as in verse 8, the Sabbath God requires of Israel. Ex. 20:11 sees an identity between these. It teaches that when God took his own rest from his creative labors and rested on the seventh day, which he hallowed and blessed, he also hallowed and blessed a human Sabbath, a Sabbath for man (Mark 2:27). In other words, when God blessed his own Sabbath rest in Gen. 2:3, he blessed it as a model for human imitation. So Israel is to keep the Sabbath, because in Gen. 2:2-3 God hallowed and blessed man’s Sabbath as well as his own. (Frame, The Doctrine of the Christian Life, unpublished edition)

This is why elsewhere the Sabbath is called God’s, because He instituted it and owns it (cf. Is. 58:13, “…the Sabbath…My holy day…”; Rev. 1:10, “…the Lord’s Day…”), and it is something that was made for man (Mk. 2:27, “the Sabbath was made for man…”). The Sabbath is God’s because of His example and institution of it. The Sabbath is man’s because God made it for him. Surely “the everlasting God, the LORD, The Creator of the ends of the earth, Neither faints nor is weary” (Is. 40:28). God did not make the Sabbath for Himself because He was tired and needed rest; He made it for man. His example at creation is imperatival for man.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I think Barcellos is right to mention Mark 2:27. Mark 2:27 surely carries us back to creation. The Sabbath was made for man, not the Jew, not Israel, for man, and men&#039;s needs have not changed nor has God&#039;s purpose. Even though their is no specific command given, who is the person who loves the Lord who would not view and honor that day thet He sanctified? Love and admiration of the Lord Who rested on that day, Who blessed and santified it, surely will lead us to see and treat it differently than any other day.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Wells writes,
&#039;To begin we see that there is nothing in Genesis 2:1-3 that commands a Sabbath for anyone.&#039;

Am I going crazy?  How can he write this stuff?
Surely Almighty God Himself contradicts it?  Did He not write upon tablets of stone,
&#039;Remember the Sabbath day and keep it holy......FOR in six days the LORD made heaven and earth....and rested the seventh day.  THEREFORE the LOrd blessed the sabbath day and hallowed it&#039;?]]></description>
