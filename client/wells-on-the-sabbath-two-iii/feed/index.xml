Those are certainly relevant texts. I will discuss them when Wells gets to them. Gal. 4:10-11 is another text rleated to these.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Colossians 2:16–17 (NAS)
16 Therefore no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink or in respect to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath day— 17 things which are a mere shadow of what is to come; but the substance belongs to Christ. 

Romans 14:5–6 (NAS)
5 One person regards one day above another, another regards every day alike. Each person must be fully convinced in his own mind. 6 He who observes the day, observes it for the Lord, and he who eats, does so for the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who eats not, for the Lord he does not eat, and gives thanks to God.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Richard:
Thanks for this explanation.  The Lord used you to open my eyes to a strong argument from Isaiah 56.  Isaiah 58 also has this same thought.  Those who are set free from captivity, spiritual, shall call the Sabbath a delight...

Is there any validity to arguing that all this occurs after chapter 53 thereby also demonstrating that the Servant of the Lord brings a people out of spiritual captivity who will obey His law?]]></description>
