					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Pastor B. -

What you say makes sense.  I have a follow-up, if you wouldn&#039;t mind...

If the Sabbath, as you convincingly state, is a type of the eternal state (the eschaton?), couldn&#039;t we then say that the fulfillment of the Sabbath is already and not-yet in the same sense that we talk of victory over death and sin, etc.?

Thanks for the help.

					<description><![CDATA[Andrew, great questions! I will deal with the change of the day in subsequent posts. As far as Christ as the ultimate fulfillment of the Sabbath, I would say this...If the Sabbath as instituted at creation was a symbol and type of the eternal state, then the Sabbath between creation and consummation is at least that. The Sabbath is not a symbol or typological of Christ, strictly speaking; it is a symbol and type of that which Christ attains for us - the eschatological state. And until that state comes in its fullness and finality, the Sabbath yet remains as its symbol and type.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[This is really well written, brother and very helpful to me, personally.  

I have one follow-up question, though...  

I understand how the NT teaches that the Temple finds its fulfillment in Christ (&#039;yields to Christ&#039;).  

I also am convinced by your argument that Jesus gives no hint of abrogating the Sabbath; this is powerful evidence of its continuance.  However, why do we not see Christ, in some sense, as the ultimate fulfillment of the Sabbath in the same way that we find Christ fulfilling the shadow/type of the Temple?  I agree that the non-ceremonial aspect of the Sabbath is universal in its extent, but to transfer it to Sunday (based on Christian tradition?) seems to be a leap beyond what the text states.]]></description>
