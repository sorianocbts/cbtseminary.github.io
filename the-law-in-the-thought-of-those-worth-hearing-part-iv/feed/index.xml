					<description><![CDATA[Pastor Mike,

I agree with Bullinger! The more I study the older theologians on this issue, the more I realize how careful they were in their doctrinal formulations. May we learn from them!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Dr. Rich,

Thanks for this continual study. I really like the title, The law in the thought of those worth hearing. May I add another man worth hearing. In 1562 Henry Bullinger authored the Second Helvetic Confession. It reads in part on the chapter entitled The Law of God:

&quot;The law is abolished inasmuch as it no more condemns and works wrath in them that believe, who are under grace, and not under the law. Besides, Christ has fulfilled all the types of the law, and put the substance in the place of the shadows; in him we have all fullness. Nevertheless, the law is useful in showing us all virtues and vices, and in regulating the life of new obedience. Christ did not come to destroy but to fulfill the law. We therefore condemn old and modern Antinomianism.&quot;]]></description>
