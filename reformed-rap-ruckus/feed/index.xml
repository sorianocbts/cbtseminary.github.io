					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate much of what you said. But I&#039;d ask you to consider something regarding this: 

&quot;I have actually never seen congregational rapping and know of no instance of it. It would have to be a whole other world before any churches I know could do this. Indeed, rap seems to me to be essentially a performance style.&quot;

This same argument was once held against rock and pop music, and probably against other genres as well. Yet now it is not the least bit unusual to find congregational rock, pop, r&#038;b, or even jazz. There&#039;s no reason rap can&#039;t cross that threshold as well. Consider this, congregational rap is just a responsive reading set to music.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Sam

Excellent post on this issue, if only the wider church would consider the importance of the distinctions that you make,

Thanks for the commits from the empty chair.

					<description><![CDATA[Thank you for this excellent statement. Your primary point is something I have been trying to express for years.  Much music performed by Christians as performance art is useful and edifying in many contexts but is inappropriate for use in public worship.  That distinction, if properly understood will allow for much progress in such discussions.]]></description>
