					<description><![CDATA[Certainly Carl Trueman  is a recipient of Grace?  Is he remembering that all his best of righteousness is a filthy rag?  Does he not embrace the words of Paul in Philippians 1: 15-18 where he rejoices… even at the preaching of the gospel in pretense, because Christ is being proclaimed?  I am sure he does, yet he writes like the Arbiter of how and when such a pretense is defined?  

Certainly the unbeliever is accountable to God for how he spends his Sunday, as is the believer.  Yet they can only follow their desires, which the media, television, mass marketing all contribute to the manipulation and managements of our desires.    Yet what part of the ‘filthy rags’ pile does the good work of Sabbath observance fall under?  Does good hallowing the Lord ’s Day allow even one occasion of mind wandering and mental hiatus taking during worship?  Or does Grace and accommodation from on high even cover that? 

Does sophistry and theological pedigree permit churlishness?  Is it expected that someone will perform the annual anti-super bowl rant to satisfy the reformed ‘purists’?  Does mockingly objectifying 300 lb linemen in spandex, and sardonically questioning the people who watch them generate a climate of receptivity and sensitivity to people’s sin and hopelessness?  Does his tenor color the irenic disposition of the gospel which he conveys to his pupils?    

The article seems belligerent, gratuitous and its conclusion is fundementally wrong.  His statement, “The spandex and hilarious commercials win every time” must unintentionally express powerlessness in the gospel. After all, “you shall call him Jesus, for he shall save His people from their sins” is true in spite of the best that the NFL and Madison Avenue can conjure up.  Recognizing the maladies of this counties culture, many Christians were reaching out to their neighbors, talking over the kitchen table with the game on in the background. Some might even have been parsing the extent of the atonement while the Black Eyed Peas were doing their thing.  Others invited the ‘un-churched’ into their evening time together, though I am sure no one plucked the heads of grain.  
 
If Paul rejoiced in the Gospel being preached in pretense, how much more ought we rejoice with those well intentioned brethren, with whom we disagree?
