					<description><![CDATA[Thank you Richard for that clear presentation.  Frankly I have been very surprised at the vigorous debate in various corners of the internet over the question &quot;Can we live the gospel?&quot;

It seems that some are having a knee-jerk reaction while others have an exceedingly broad definition of &#039;THE GOSPEL&#039; which takes in anything tangentially related to Soteriology.

					<description><![CDATA[I think that this idea has to inform all of our preaching/exposition of God&#039;s word. If &quot;what God has done for sinners&quot; is not preached in every message (somehow), why even preach? I, for one, am tired of limp, man-centered ethical discourses that try to pass themselves off for true preaching. I want to worship when I listen to preaching and the only way THAT happens is if the message is aimed at my sinful heart in an attempt to remedy it&#039;s coldness by extolling the virtues and glories of Jesus. And when I say worship, I don&#039;t mean singing. Is it too much to ask for an existential experience of Glory while listening to preaching that is comprable to that which occurs when singing good theological lyrics accompanied by great music? God help us to lift up His glories when we preach!]]></description>
