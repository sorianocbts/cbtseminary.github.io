					<description><![CDATA[Dear Bob,

Romans 2:14-15 has nothing to do with it.  It may be saying that the Gentiles do for themselves the same thing the law does: inform them of right and wrong, accuse them, commend them, or condemn them.  I think this is what it is saying.  On the other hand, if it is saying that they actually do the things of the law, that is, things that are right, then it is speaking of external acts of righteousness.  No Calvinists denies that unsaved people can sometimes do external acts of righteousness.  This is way different than saying that they have the moral ability to do spiritual good.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Anthony,

Like I said it all goes back to your definition of free will.  Since this is not a biblical phrase, I will go with the Confessional definition of natural liberty as equivalent to free will.  Thanks for the interaction.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[How does this &quot;bound&quot; free will take into account Ro 2:14-15 — For when the Gentiles do by nature the things contained in the law,… show the law written on their hearts; their consciences the meanwhile witnessing…&quot;

It seems to me that they are just as free to do what is lawful and good (Ro 7:12)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Excellent and refreshing clarity for generations under 40 years of age who do not possess vocabulary for the language of virtue, so they can&#039;t articulate even noble thoughts they might have. I am on the side of the argument that without words we can not form thoughts. We can have impressions, insights, longings for truth but without out words we can&#039;t formulate thoughts and therefore can&#039;t think. In the same way you can long to write  music for piano which you can hear in your head, but it is impossible if you don&#039;t know the keys and notes. So it follows, if that is true, that generations which have no 
vocabulary for biblical concepts and virtue can only intuit from a sense of right and wrong, but can&#039;t formulate actual thought, much less express it in written form. 
One of the labors or preachers or teachers is to equip people with sound language from which they can engage in thought.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Pastor Waldron,
  I have enjoyed your ministry very much over the years having learned so many things.
Last heard you preach live on Elijah by the drying brook as you were a guest speaker in Ontario California I believe.
 One area where I differ on is your understanding of mans will. I understand how you frame it out as in this blog and your book on the 1689.
 I know your are well acquainted with those who have gone before us, Luther, Edwards,Spurgeon,and even Pastor Chantry...among others.
 If we were discussing this at the coffee shop I would offer this....
Jesus in John 6:38 declares  -
38 For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.

As the Sent One..the Servant of The Lord of isa.
As the last Adam....among all He came to accomplish in His active and passive obedience..
He never acted&quot;independantly&quot; of the WILL of The Father.
The temptation of Satan,lk4...was to act &quot;independently&quot; of the Fathers will.

I believe we are to think God&#039;s thoughts after Him.
The term free will itself I believe to be a philosophical term more than a biblical term.
I recall men are called self willed in their unbelief.
We are &quot;free&quot; to serve In Christ.
We are never &quot;free&quot; to sin even though for a season still able to.
In heaven we will not be &quot;free&quot; to sin in the glorified state will we???

I understand you are not suggesting such with your explanation as an Arminian will go to the mats over this. You offer a nuanced explanation.
However.... I think such an attempt leaves the door open to those who oppose themselves and have exalted mans will into Idolatrous Status.
as soon as you mention that terminology I think they make a mental check mark and say....it is an attempt to hold to the same teaching as they do.

I am just a regular believer....I drive commercially cross country for a living so I am offering this by way of feed back....I had hoped to see you face to face sometime to discuss this with you since I read your commentary on the 1689.

Again.....if this is the only thing I have found to differ with you on over these many years I am really ahead of the game and am so thankful for your faithful labors in the word. I have learned so much from you, and all our Reformed Baptist brothers that I should just keep it to myself...but I thought I might ask you about how you see Jesus as the true man, conforming us to his Image....and how we will life in eternity, is &quot;free will&quot; as is commonly used even valid?
 Is God Himself &quot;free&quot; to act contrary to His own , holy immutable attributes and perfections?
How could this even be conceivable?

Is free will a product of carnal natural mans speculations, or perhaps Lucifer trying to act independently of the safe harbor of God&#039;s law/word?
Sorry to ramble a bit...maybe too many diesel fumes,lol...Yours In Christ, TonyD]]></description>
