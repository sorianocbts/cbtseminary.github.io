					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/datpostmil-a-friendly-and-reluctant-response-to-james-white-and-all-my-postmillennial-friends/#comment-523&quot;&gt;Steven Steenbergen&lt;/a&gt;.

I am afraid that postmillenialism is loose thinking, in that it is not sufficiently careful to discern that the interadventual kingdom is a spiritual one of &quot;righteousness, peace and joy in the Holy Spirit,&quot; not one that is generally and globally manifested by outward phyical appearance. That will come at the second appearance of King Jesus, in glory.

Also it fails to discern the greater glory of the 1st new covenant advent of Christ, in contrast with the lesser glory of the OT. I have a lot of respect and appreciation for the reformers and Puritans, but they fell short by maintaining the paedobaptism and sacralism (church/state unequal yoke) of papal Rome. We must honor Christ and these faithful historical witnesses by growing in grace and knowledge. Semper reformanda--always reforming!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I appreciate your very clear and well written presentation on this subject. I have also greatly benefited from your books and lectures on eschatology. I am a convinced optimistic amillennialist. Other works by Martyn Lloyd Jones, Anthony Hoekema, William Hendriksen, Joel Beeke, and W.J. Grier have also been helpful to my understanding. 
However, I do not believe postmillennialism is “loose thinking.” This sounds a bit arrogant like you’re saying postmillennialists are not quite putting enough study and thought into their position. I would never have the audacity to say that men like John Owen and Jonathan Edwards (both postmillennialists) were engaged in “loose thinking” in terms of their eschatology. I believe this is a very inaccurate and unfair characterization.]]></description>
