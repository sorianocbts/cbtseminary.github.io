					<description><![CDATA[Thanks, brother for taking time with this. It seems to me that part of the &quot;dilemma&quot; arises from two faulty presuppositions; 1) In evangelistic preaching we are to proclaim to the individual sinner that Christ died for him, 2) The individual sinner must believe that Christ died for him in particular. However, the New Testament never bears witness to the Apostles proclaiming to sinners that Christ died for them in particular, nor does it bear witness to them calling sinners to believe that Christ died for them in particular. The proclamation (Acts) is that Christ, the one who died and arose from the dead saves all those who repent and believe. He, Christ, is the object of saving faith, not the atonement. Of course, one must believe in the atoning work of Christ, and believe in its sufficiency as being the sole just basis for a holy God to pardon sinners, but one may believe that while not believing in Him (John 3:16).]]></description>
