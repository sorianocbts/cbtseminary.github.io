					<description><![CDATA[It seems to me that Paul is making some generalised pastoral teaching to the Corinthians.  

His references to idolatry are almost metaphorical in nature to illustrate the principle of sanctification or setting apart which is a basic biblical theme.

To limit the application of this sanctification principle to acts of idolatry alone is IMO too narrow a reading of the text.  Strictly speaking partnership relationships bear considerable similarities with covenant relationships and these have already been pointed out by earlier commentators in this thread.

Formal Business Partnerships as defined in law are but one form of &quot;partnership.&quot;  Other situations are more nuanced and need care to consider.  For example, what about buying a 65% holding in a closely held company that has great growth prospects but the other 35% is held by a non-Christian with known anti-Christian views and if he knew of your beliefs would only sell his portion over his dead body?

If the new Christian investor proceeds with the purchase, s/he should prudently put in place a set of contingency plans for managing that relationship, one contingency might involve working out how to remove that 35% owner in the interests of promoting long term harmony.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[All I am saying is that 2 Cor. 6:14 is not a universal prohibition against business partnerships between believers and unbelievers. It is not necessarily sinful to enter into such partnerships. God&#039;s law does not forbid it. Christians are free to, though certainly not commanded to. It is lawful, though maybe not profitable. This is an isue of Christian liberty and prudence. Hence, one ought to seek informed counsel and weigh options and pray and etc. prior to entering into such. BTW, reader, do you own any stocks? That can be a sticky issue. :-)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[The verse seems simple and clear to me. Read it in its immediate context and its wider Corinthian letter context and my view makes perfect sense. Obviously, whatever was happening, it was a sin against God&#039;s law. I am prepared to say that idolatry is a sin in every case, but I am not prepared to say that entering into business partnerships between believers and unbelievers is a sin in every case.

Also, I think the view I am not advocating smuggles something into the text that can&#039;t be proved from the text or its context.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Various other thoughts:

Where is the universal biblical prohibition against entering into business partnerships between believers and unbelievers from this text? No commentary I checked holds this view, which only means that no commentary I checked holds this view. :-) I do not want to bind someone based on the bad experiences of others. Cautious? By all means. Universal prohibition? I don&#039;t think Paul meant that, at least from this text.

Also, if you read the passage (6:14-7:1), it seems clear that Paul is dealing with issues related to idolatry, something he dealt with in 1 Cor. 10 (cf. esp. vv. 14-22). The OT echoes in the passage include Ezra 6:21 and Isa. 52:11, which appear to deal with covenantal uncleanness or idolatry.

I am arguing against using 2 Cor. 6:14 as a universal prohibition against believers entering business partnerships with unbelievers. I don&#039;t think the context is dealing with that issue and I fail to see how it can be inferred that such constitutes idolatry, which it would have to in order to fit the text. The idolatry Paul dealt with in 1 Cor. 10 is, most likely, the background of this passage. Apparently (cf. 1 Cor. 10:14-22), some Corinthians did not think what Paul addresses there was idolatrous.

For sake of clarity, the question at stake is: Is 2 Cor. 6:14 a universal prohibition forbidding all business partnerships between believers and unbelievers? My take on the text is that it is a universal prohibition forbidding Christians from entering into pagan worship, which is a form of idolatry (cf. 1 Cor. 10:14-22).

For those arguing from practical considerations to this text universally prohibiting all business partnerships between believers and unbelievers, though I sympathize with your position, I do not think it bears the weight of this text in its various contexts.

					<description><![CDATA[After thinking about the passage more and consulting several commentaries (none of which said this text is a universal prohibition against all business partnerships between believers and unbelivers), I think it has to do specifically with the idolatry mentioned in 1 Cor. 10:14-22. Apparently, some Corinthians still thought that participating in pagan sacrificial meals was permitted. Paul assured them it was idolatry (1 Cor. 10:14-22) and reinforces the point here. The language of the text is covenantal and vertical, not horizontal.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[I must disagree. Have you ever run a business? Do you understand the dynamics of a business partnership versus and employee-employer relationship? 

They are not close to being the same. An employee-employer relationship is one that involves a superior-subordinate relationship, is at will, and may be easily terminated at any time by either party for any reason. People understand the disconnect between employers and employees, and that one does not necessarily represent the other.

A business partner is an entirely different matter. You co-own property with him, share representation with him with employees and clients, and share a reputation together. His acts are seen as your acts, and his ethics as yours. He can bind you to contracts, and you him. Such relationships are very difficult to sever.

A business partnership is more like a marriage than anything else - the sexual, child raising, and co-habitation component is missing, but everything else is there in terms of entanglement with another person. 

I was in business for 15 years and had 16 full time employees, and I would NEVER enter into a business partnership with an unsaved person. The entanglements and compromises that would occur would be enormous. It is NOT and arm&#039;s length relationship like an employer-employee relationship is. There is no comparison between the two.]]></description>
